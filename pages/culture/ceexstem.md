**A very traditional** _Nimíipuu_ game, shared throughout the Plateau region is called _Céexstem_, a form of dice game. Formally played by women, today both men and women of all ages enjoy the excitement of _Céexstem_. The goal of the game is to see who can reach the agreed upon point total first. Any number of individuals can play at one time. The game is a wonderful way to learn the number system of the _Nimíipuu_, counting from _náaqc_ (one) to _le_ '_dptit_ (twenty), and have a lot of fun doing so!

To play the game, you need two sets of game sticks, each set colored a different color, e.g., blue and red, and each set marked indicating a _áayet_ (male) and _hamma_ (female), a "couple." The male stick is often marked with an extra perpendicular line across it. The reverse side of a stick is called, _caya_, "nothing." Before starting the players agree upon the number of points to win, the higher the number, the more challenging and the more fun. Typically, 5, 7 or 11 point totals are selected. Usually starting with the youngest player and proceeding to that person's right, each person throws the four game sticks onto the rug before them. Depending on how the sticks land, the following points are possible:

- one "couple," a _áayet_ and a _hamma_ of the same color = one point
- two "couples," both sets of _áayet_ and a _hamma_ sticks = three points
- one _áayet_ and two _hamma_ = two points. This combination refers to the _Nimíipuu_ practice of looking after a male friend's wife should he fall in combat.
- if there are no pairs matched, e.g., _áayet_ and a _hamma_ of differing colors = no points
- but if all the sticks land _caya_, "nothing" = all points accumulated are lost and the player starts over.

After deciding on the win point total, be it 5, 7, or 11, the players need to agree on other rules. Will you need to win on the exact number, be it 5, 7 or 11, not going over that total? If a player gains points beyond the agreed upon win point total, will extra points over that total be subtracted from that player's earned points? As players gain points, they should always announce their totals in _Nimíipuutimptneewit_.

Special thanks to Kevin Peters for sharing _Céexstem_ with us and for helping revive and keep this game alive for his people.
