**While the horse** was welcomed into the _Nimíipuu_ family, another Euro-American derived newcomer had a devastating effect. A series of smallpox epidemics, beginning in the 1780s and continuing through the 1850s, wrought disaster upon the _Nimíipuu_ and all the Indian tribes of the region. There were no natural immunities to ward off these diseases. Besides smallpox, which was the most serious of the diseases, measles, scarlet fever, chickenpox and whooping cough took their toll. Spreading from the east with returning buffalo hunters and from the west up the Columbia River from white sea traders, entire _Nimíipuu_ families, camps and villages were wiped out.

Not only was there a tremendous loss of life, estimated to be up to half the entire _Nimíipuu_ population, but with the death of elders came a loss in ceremonial and subsistence knowledge necessary to successfully journey the seasonal round, and with the death of infants came a generation that was not to be. One can not imagine the cries of grief coming from the grandmothers! When Lewis and Clark came across the Bitterroots in 1805, were among an estimated 6,000 _Nimíipuu_. By the end of the nineteenth century, there were less than 1,600 _Nimíipuu_.

What occurred for the _Nimíipuu_ occurred throughout the region. As a direct result of the epidemics that swept over the entire of the Columbia River Plateau region, of the over 100,000 inhabitants that populated the area prior to the introduction of the various diseases, by 1890 the Indian population was estimated to be only 17,000!
