Coyote . . . was going upstream.

**Coyote** is a-a-lways going upstream.

And . . . he's going upstream,

and he's going along the Clearwater
{:.indent-1}

and he noticed . . . that Salmon . . . were having some difficultly there,
{:.indent-2}

so, "**I'll** build a fish ladder so that the Salmon can go upriver
{:.indent-3}

and feed my people."
{:.indent-4}

And so he's busy working along there,

and . . a Magpie flew over
{:.indent-1}

and says
{:.indent-2}

"**Wha-a-t's you doin**, Coyote?"
{:.indent-3}

And Coyote looked up and says

"**I-'m-m** building a fish ladder for the fish to go up,
{:.indent-1}

you know,
{:.indent-2}

to feed my people."
{:.indent-3}

And . . . Magpie looked at him

"**Ah-h-h-h**, there's **no reason** for the fish to go up there.
{:.indent-1}

**The Monster**, **Its-welks**, ate them all up."
{:.indent-2}

He's up in the valley,
{:.indent-3}

near Kamiah."
{:.indent-4}

And Coyote says,

"Oh-h-h-h, **that's** what happened to them.
{:.indent-1}

Oh, no wonder **nobody's** been around to help me."
{:.indent-2}

So . . he starts up that way

and he stops along the way
{:.indent-1}

and he takes a sweat bath.
{:.indent-2}

He **cleans** himself up **re-e-al** nice, you know,

and he says,
{:.indent-1}

"Well, I'd better sweat real good to get my **power**,
{:.indent-2}

and also to clean myself in case the Monster . . . ,
{:.indent-3}

if he should **eat me** he won't find me repulsive!"
{:.indent-4}

And so he takes a sweat bath.

And along the way he's going up over . . the Camas Prairie,

and he stops and he gets some flint
{:.indent-1} 

and makes some knives,
{:.indent-2}

flint knives,
{:.indent-3}

and makes something to start fire
{:.indent-2} 

and he grabs some . . dry moss and things.
{:.indent-3}

As he goes along,

he gets some . . camas
{:.indent-1}

and some . . elderberries
{:.indent-2}

and other . . serviceberries
{:.indent-3}

and things like this
{:.indent-4}

and he puts them . . all in his . . . pack
{:.indent-1}

And . . . he gets himself and he's on his way,

and he's making these **ropes** out of hemp.
{:.indent-1}

And he **goes** along,

ah-h he's thinking of a plan.
{:.indent-1}

He said,

"Oh-h-h, I miss all my friends.
{:.indent-1}

**I was wondering** where Fox went, you know,
{:.indent-2}

**Oh-h-h**"
{:.indent-3}

So he . . gets up to the top of the prairie,

"Well . . . , I'd better tie this rope around Mason Butte . . "
{:.indent-1}

And he goes and ties it around there

And he goes up and ties one rope around Seven Devil Mountains,

and the other around . . . **Cottonwood** Butte . .
{:.indent-1}

And he ties them around his waist

And Coyote gets up to the Breaks and looking into Kamiah,

and, "Ah-h-h, I don't want him to see me right away."
{:.indent-1}

So he **covers** himself . . with clay

and he's sort of . . . hard to see
{:.indent-1}

And he **pe-e-e-ks** over the side there, you know,

and spreads the weeds . . . and grass and what not
{:.indent-1}

and **lo-o-o-ks** over
{:.indent-2}

and sees the Monster.
{:.indent-3}

**Monster** has just eaten a whole bunch,

and he's sort of laying there . . . sleeping,
{:.indent-1}

with his head on his hands, you know,
{:.indent-2}

sleeping away,
{:.indent-3}

"ah-ah-ah-ah." (whispering voice)
{:.indent-4}

Coyote yells out, (whispering voice)

"**Its-we-e-lks, Its-we-e-lks** . . !" (loud voice)
{:.indent-1}

The Monster looks around,

"**Who's** that? you know,
{:.indent-1}

who's that calling me?"
{:.indent-2}

He looks around . . over . . the Breaks,

and he can't see anybody.
{:.indent-1}

Coyote is well-camouflaged . . .

And . . he says,

"**Who is** that?"
{:.indent-1}

And Coyote says,

"**It's me** . . !" (louder)
{:.indent-1}

Monster looks,

"'It's me'?
{:.indent-1}

Who's 'It's me'?
{:.indent-2}

I don't know anybody named, 'It's me' . . !"
{:.indent-1}

And Coyote **stood** up

and he said
{:.indent-1}

"**It's me, Coyote**." (loud voice)
{:.indent-2}

"**Oh-h-h, there you are**.

**What are you** doing up there . . ?"
{:.indent-1}

"**Well**, I come down

and we're . . going to test our powers out.
{:.indent-1}

We're going to . . . see who's going to **draw** each other in . . "
{:.indent-2}

And the Monster,

"Haugh, haugh,
{:.indent-1}

**okay, alright**, you go first.
{:.indent-2}

We'll do it **three** times . . "
{:.indent-1}

So Coyote gets up there

and he checks his ropes, you know,
{:.indent-1}

and he's all tied up nice.
{:.indent-2}

And he goes

"Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!"
{:.indent-1}

And the only thing that happens is that maybe a hair on Monster's ear . . . wiggles around.

"Haugh, haugh, haugh."

Coyote yells down at him

"**It's your turn**, Its-welks,
{:.indent-1}

**you try** to suck me in."
{:.indent-2}

So Its-welks opens his mouth and,

"Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!"
{:.indent-1}

And the Coyote starts going down

but the ropes hold him back . . . .
{:.indent-1}

And Its-welks looks

"**He-e-e-y**!
{:.indent-1}

He's got a lot more power than I thought, you know!"
{:.indent-2}

"Okay, it's your turn."

And Coyote gets up there,

"Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!"
{:.indent-1}

A-a-a-nd nothing happens, you know

Monster goes

"Hey-hey-hey-hey, haugh haugh haugh.
{:.indent-1}

I knew he couldn't do anything, you know.
{:.indent-2}

He thinks he's got power.
{:.indent-3}

**I-'ve** got more power."
{:.indent-4}

And Coyote says

"**Ok-a-ay, it's** your turn."
{:.indent-1}

So . . Its-welks, he opens his mouth

and drives in the **biggest** air.
{:.indent-1}

"Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh."
{:.indent-2}

And with that Coyote cuts some of the ropes

and starts sli-i-ding down the hill, you know.
{:.indent-1}

And the Monster's just about got him,

maybe the next time...
{:.indent-1}

"**Your** turn Coyote."

And Coyote,

"Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh."
{:.indent-1}

And no-o-thing happened

and Monster's sitting there,
{:.indent-1}

"**Hey-hey-hey**, haugh-haugh-haugh."
{:.indent-2}

"**Ok-a-ay** get ready now!"

And he opens his mouth,

"Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh."
{:.indent-1}

And Coyote goes **flying** through the air,

he reaches into his backpack,
{:.indent-1}

and throws out the roots and berries he brought with him.
{:.indent-2}

And he says,

"Soon, the human beings will be coming,
{:.indent-1}

and they will find these
{:.indent-2}

and be happy!"
{:.indent-3}

And Coyote went **scootching** into his mouth, you know

"Aam-aam-aam-ay-ay-ay."

Its-welks lies down . . . ,

and he's content there
{:.indent-1}

And Coyote is inside,

he gets his flint
{:.indent-1}

and makes a little torch
{:.indent-2}

And he goes along,

and . . sees all these animals,
{:.indent-1}

all these friends . . . and what not
{:.indent-2}

and, "**Hello hello**."
{:.indent-1}

And they're glad to see him,

some of them are jumping up and down.
{:.indent-1}

And Old Grizzly Bear comes up,

Bear comes up,
{:.indent-1}

"**Gra-ah, r-a-a-ah**!"
{:.indent-2}

"**What are** you doing here?
{:.indent-3}

**I was** going to save the people.
{:.indent-4}
**You didn't** have to come down."
{:.indent-5}

And Coyote looks at him,

"What are you getting so worked up for?
{:.indent-1}

You are so **ferocious** to **m-e-e**,
{:.indent-2}

**why** are you doing that?"
{:.indent-3}

And pushed him in the nose, you know,

pushed him back out of the way.
{:.indent-1}

And that's why the Grizzly Bear has a different kind of nose than the Black Bear . . !

And . . . he's going along with his light, you know,

and Fox ran up to him.
{:.indent-1}

"**Fox**, how are you?"

"I'm doing just fine!

I was wondering when you were going to come and save us."
{:.indent-1}

"Well . , I need some help.

You go and get all the boys together,
{:.indent-1}

and you have them gather all the bones of all the dead people,
{:.indent-2}

and put them by all the openings,
{:.indent-3}

and then have them gather a-a-ll the wood
{:.indent-4}

{:.indent-5}
and bring it to the heart.

{:.indent-1}
But you have to show me where the heart is, you know."

And so Coyote goes on.

Fox runs on,

and tells all the boys,
{:.indent-1}

and they gather the bones of the dead people
{:.indent-2}

{:.indent-3}
and they put them by **a-a-ll** the openings, you know.

They gather wood,

{:.indent-1}
and they show him where the **heart is** . .

But on the way there . . . they run into Rattlesnake,

and Rattlesnake is just **mad** . . and **rattling**,
{:.indent-1}

{:.indent-2}
"Chish, chish, chish, . . . wish, chish, chish . . . . .

**What** are you doing here?
{:.indent-1}

I was going to save the people.
{:.indent-2}

{:.indent-3}
I'm the one who has the **power**." you know

And Coyote says,

"**Oh**, you are so ferocious to everybody else,
{:.indent-1}

{:.indent-2}
and to me! you know.

{:.indent-1}
**Ah**, you are nothing but a **pest**!"

And **stepped** on his . . . head,

{:.indent-1}
and that's why a Rattlesnake has a flat head.

And he says,

"From now on,
{:.indent-1}

{:.indent-2}
you're just going to be a **pest**.

And you'll really be . . **scared** of people
{:.indent-1}

{:.indent-2}
and you'll **run away** when they come by.

But . . . sometimes you'll be brave
{:.indent-1}

{:.indent-2}
and they'll **kill** you."

And that's what happens to rattlesnakes today . . !

But he found the heart.

Coyote takes pitch from his backpack,

{:.indent-1}
and starts a fire with the gathered wood under the Monster's heart.

He jumped on the heart.

Took one of his five knives out
{:.indent-1}

{:.indent-2}
and he starts cutting away at the heart.

Smoke begins to come out the Monster's eyes,

ears,
{:.indent-1}

nose
{:.indent-2}

{:.indent-3}
and back end.

And as he cuts into the heart

Its-welks, Monster,
{:.indent-1}

"O-o-oh, I'm getting heart burn.
{:.indent-2}

**O-o-oh**, **I knew** I shouldn't have eaten that Coyote,
{:.indent-3}

{:.indent-4}
O-o-oh."

And he opens his mouth and some of his openings

and . . . **a-a-ll** the boys throw out the bones,
{:.indent-1}

{:.indent-2}
as many as possible.

And he keeps cutting,

and every time he'd do that
{:.indent-1}

the Monster, Its-welks,
{:.indent-2}

{:.indent-3}
"**O-o-o-oh**, o-o-oh."

And Coyote keeps cutting,

and everything he does,
{:.indent-1}

that Monster,
{:.indent-2}

{:.indent-3}
"**O-o-o-oh**,"

and everything opens up
{:.indent-1}

{:.indent-2}
and the boys throw out more bones.

Coyote breaks one knife,

and then another,
{:.indent-1}

{:.indent-2}
and finally he is down to his **last** knife, and what not.

Coyote keeps cutting away at the heart.

And he says to the people,

"As soon . . as he opens up again,
{:.indent-1}

you all **run out**
{:.indent-2}

and I'll **run** out too . . ,
{:.indent-3}

{:.indent-4}
and he'll be **dead**."

So he cuts it and cuts it and cuts it,

and finally the **last** knife breaks
{:.indent-1}

{:.indent-2}
and the heart falls off.

And the Monster goes,

{:.indent-1}
"**O-o-o-o-o-oh**!"

And with that . . **everybody** runs out . . . ,

out of his **nose**,
{:.indent-1}

out of his **eyes**,
{:.indent-2}

out of his **ears**,
{:.indent-3}

out his **mouth**,
{:.indent-4}

{:.indent-5}
out of the **back end** . .

And . . **Muskrat** . . was the last one to run out of the back end.

{:.indent-1}
But he was **slo-o-ow** . .

And as the Monster died he closed his back end . . . . over the Muskrat's furry tail,

{:.indent-1}
**beautiful** furry tail.

And Muskrat,

{:.indent-1}
"**Oh, no**!"

And he's sitting there, pulling his tail,

{:.indent-1}
and he's pulled all his hair off.

And Coyote looked at him,

"**And** now what will you do?
{:.indent-1}

You're **always** being the last one out.
{:.indent-2}

{:.indent-3}
You'll be just a scavenger the rest of your life!"

That's why Muskrat doesn't have any hair on his tail . . !

And at this point . . the . . . animals all are standing around

{:.indent-1}
and . . . he starts . . . cutting the Monster up.

And gets some blood,


and . . . sprinkles it on the bones . . . ,
{:.indent-1}

{:.indent-2}
and **a-a-ll** those . . dead people come to life.

And **everybody's** going,

{:.indent-1}
"**Yeah, yeah**, yeah," you know.

Monster's all dead,

and . . . with the help of his friends,
{:.indent-1}

{:.indent-2}
they cut up the Monster,

{:.indent-1}
and they throw different parts into different areas.

The feet landed over toward Montana

{:.indent-1}
and that's where the **Blackfeet** came from.

Part of the head he threw over to another part of Montana,

{:.indent-1}
and the **Flatheads**, you know, came over from there.

And . . . part of the tail,

{:.indent-1}
they threw over to . . . the **Umatillas**.

And they threw some south,

{:.indent-1}
the **Navajos** . . ,

{:.indent-2}
and the **Shoshone**,

{:.indent-3}
and every place . . else.

They threw part of the belly over into Montana

{:.indent-1}
and that's the **Assiniboine** . . the "**big bellies**!"

And . . . ah, he was busy just **throwing** meat every which way,

{:.indent-1}
parts of the Monster

And Fox comes up to him and says . . . ,

"**What about** the **people here**? . . .
{:.indent-1}

{:.indent-2}
**You forgot all about them**."

The only thing left was the heart,

the kidney,
{:.indent-1}

{:.indent-2}
and a breast.

I guess the Monster was a woman.

Anyway,

and he says,
{:.indent-1}

"**Oh**, I forgot **a-a-ll** about that . . . .
{:.indent-2}

Go get some water from this clear . . . river,
{:.indent-3}

{:.indent-4}
the Clearwater \[River\]."

And he got him water.

"Now **pour** it over my hands."

And Coyote washed his blood off, you know,

{:.indent-1}
and it dripped down.

He said,

"Where this blood . . . lands
{:.indent-1}

and with this heart will grow a people . . .
{:.indent-2}

They'll be **strong**.
{:.indent-3}

They'll be **brave**.
{:.indent-4}

They'll have **good** hearts.
{:.indent-5}

{:.indent-5}
They will lead good lives.

{:.indent-1}
And these will be the Nez Perce . . . "

And that's where the Nez Perce came from . . .
