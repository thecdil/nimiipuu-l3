**The Nez Perce Tribe and Tribal members** have been concerned about the state of _Nimíipuutimptneewit_ (Nez Perce Language) since the early part of the 20th Century. Archie Phinney, the first Plateau Indian to receive a Ph.D., wrote his dissertation on Nez Perce stories, recording the stories of his mother that were already being lost from the memory of his people. In the 1970's, David Arthur first began to teach _Nimíipuutimptneewit_ at Lewis-Clark State College, and he was followed by the Rev. David Miles, and by Horace Axtell.

In 1996, the Nez Perce Tribe began a concerted effort to reverse the progress of language loss. Evening classes were begun for adults and afternoon classes for children. Since that time, additional classes have been added for high schoolers, Tribal employees, and younger children.

The Tribe and Lewis-Clark State College have developed a partnership in which the Tribe supports classes in Nez Perce given at the college level. There are now three years of _Nimíipuutimptneewit_ given at LCSC, and students can achieve a minor in Nez Perce. The partnership has been extended to the University of Idaho, with first and second year _Nimíipuutimptneewit_ offered, via compressed video link. The Tribe has developed first and second year textbooks. The second year text is based on the Coyote stories told by elders of a generation ago. Third year students are mentored directly by elders. The classes are taught by a team of elders and a college professor. The goal is to train new speakers of the language who can subsequently teach at the area schools and pre-schools.
