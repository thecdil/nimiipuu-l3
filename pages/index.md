## Scenario

**In this module** you will be introduced to the _Nimíipuu_, also called the Nez Perce. We have a rich and vibrant culture, which has existed since time immemorial and which continues to this day. As a result of your engagement in this module, you will gain a better understanding of the influence of the _Nimíipuu_ not only on Lewis and Clark and the Corps of Discovery, but also on American history and culture. You will also gain an appreciation of how the Corps of Discovery impacted the _Nimíipuu_.

**From our perspective,** that of the _Nimíipuu_, you can glimpse our aboriginal culture before the arrival of the Corps of Discovery, and how it has continued to this day. You will then explore the significance of the arrival of Lewis and Clark among our people. How did we, the _Nimíipuu_, view the "discovery" of these strangers and the new world they brought with them? But as Lewis and Clark simply opened the door to a new and critical relationship with the American people, you can also explore what followed in the wake of Lewis and Clark. How did the missionaries, military generals, and treaty commissioners impact the _Nimíipuu_? Finally, you will conclude with an overview of the _Nimíipuu_ today, considering some of the important initiatives and challenges we now face and how we are reasserting our sovereign rights.

Throughout this presentation, you can learn of the extensive knowledge the _Nimíipuu_ have had and continue to use in successfully living in our environment, and in the management of our natural and cultural resources.
