**While many of the missionaries** who worked among the _Nimíipuu_ maintained that these were a people without "religion," a spiritual way of life was and continues to pervade all aspects of _Nimíipuu_ life and is of central importance. When the camas is dug, a powwow begins, a meal is eaten, a tribal council meeting commences, a state basketball championship is honored, all are occasions that begin with prayer to the Creator. The acknowledgment of their [spiritual origins]({{ '/culture/oral-traditions.html' | relative_url }}) and the continued nurturance that comes from their spiritual path is so integrated into the way the _Nimíipuu_ [make a living]({{ '/culture/winter-to-summer.html' | relative_url }}), structure their [families and communities]({{ '/culture/family.html' | relative_url }}), that "religion," per se, is indistinguishable from being _Nimíipuu_.

An important dimension of a traditional _Nimíipuu_ life revolves around acquiring and properly caring for one's _weyekin_, one's spirit guide or tutelary spirit. As a young person and following proper instructions and ritual cleansing, individual _Nimíipuu_ would go to the high mountains and other sacred places to seek his _weyekin_. Coming in the form of an Animal Spirit, for instance, Eagle, Elk or Bear, the individual would be instructed and taught his _weyekin_ song. In addition, _weyekin_ can also be passed down from generation to generation, through the family members, inherited from a great grandfather from the distant past. Once received and if respected and properly cared for, one's personal guardian spirit would be with that youth for the rest of his life, helping protect and nurture. Each year with the coming of the important Winter Dances, individuals would sing their _weyekin_ songs and dance in honor of their _weyekin_ spirit guardian. For the healers, and hunting and salmon leaders, for example, their particular _weyekin_ songs would also be used in curing ceremonies and to ask for a successful deer hunt or salmon catch.

The Sweat House ceremony is a ritual of prayer, of spiritual cleansing and renewal, of healing, and of just plain enjoyment. Held throughout the year in domed-shaped canvas-covered structures, a Sweat House may be located in the backyard of someone's home in Lapwai, or along a valley creek outside of town. After the rocks are heated red hot and placed in the pit within the lodge, the ritual begins. Men and women will generally sweat separate from each other. With the pouring of the water in prescribed ways, songs are sung and prayers are given in the intense heat. Sweats may be taken weekly, for a birthday celebration, before an important trip, prior to a major ceremony, such as the Washat, for example. A very special and spiritually powerful form of ritual bathing is known as the "Mud Bath," or _Teméeyenwees_.

The Washat, sometimes referred to as the Seven Drum or "Longhouse" way of the _Nimíipuu_, a spiritual path shared by many other tribes throughout the region, emphasizes, among many vital teachings that the salmon will return annual to help nourish both the bodies and spirits of the people. During April of each year the First Salmon Feast is held to celebrate the salmon's return and to help renew the life of all the peoples.

The families that make up the _Nimíipuu_ communities today are a rich tapestry of those who follow the Seven Drum and traditional ways, and those who are devout Presbyterians, Methodist or Catholic. All are deeply spiritual _Nimíipuu_.
