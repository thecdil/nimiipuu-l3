Nimíipuu L3, from Lifelong Learning Online - the Lewis & Clark Rediscovery Project

<https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/nimiipuu-l3/> 

> In this module you will be introduced to the Nimíipuu, also called the Nez Perce. We have a rich and vibrant culture, which has existed since time immemorial and which continues to this day. As a result of your engagement in this module, you will gain a better understanding of the influence of the Nimíipuu not only on Lewis and Clark and the Corps of Discovery, but also on American history and culture. You will also gain an appreciation of how the Corps of Discovery impacted the Nimíipuu.

The original module published in 2002 was migrated multiple times before eventually being transferred to the University of Idaho Library for continued access.

## 2025 Migration

The old HTML and RealMedia format files were a challenge for current access.
Due to recovery and multiple migrations, the source files were a maze with numerous issues.

In 2025, in consultation with Rodney Frey and his contacts, Evan Williamson migrated the content and converted media assets for modern access.

The content was extracted from the old site and converted to Markdown. 
Information about all images, documents, audio, and video were extracted and converted into a metadata spreadsheet.
Audio and video assets were converted from RealMedia to MP4.
Everything was reorganized and renamed to ensure simpler access to the source.
