**Since time immemorial** and with an extensive and intimate knowledge of the animals, plants and fishes, the _Nimíipuu_ have successfully traveled the seasonal cycle within their [aboriginal territory.]({{ '/culture/territory.html' | relative_url }}) The seasonal round was "transhumance" in nature, a deliberate and calculated movement by _Nimíipuu_ families to each of the rich fish, root and animal foods available during the season; it was anything but a random "nomadic" existence.

While identifying a variety of ways of marking time, it is the activities of the plants, animals and humans, each in close interaction with one another, that most distinguishes the character of the _Nimíipuu_ calendar.

With four seasons and twelve moons generally recognized, we can begin the journey with the end of the winter and the dawn of a new year, **'_elwéht_** (spring) and the months of _latíit_'_al_ "First flowers bloom" (March) and _qeqit_'_ál_ "Time to dig keh-kheet roots" (April). The names of the moons are closely linked to the activities pursued at that time of the year. While coming out of the winter with some foods having become scarce, the _Nimíipuu_ [families]({{ '/culture/family.html' | relative_url }}) begin traveling during the spring in small mobile groups and are welcomed by the flowering of the first root foods. It is the beginning of root digging season.

Among the important roots dug by women are [cous (_Lomatium cous_)](#nimiipuu-l3-045), wild carrot (_Perideridia gairdneri_), bitterroot (_Lewisia rediviva_), and the [blue-flowering camas (_Camassia quamash_)](#nimiipuu-l3-263). The digging stick is called a [_tuukes_](#nimiipuu-l3-273). Cous is grounded with a [stone _píley_ (pestle)](#nimiipuu-l3-045) and can be made into a [handcake called, _capkíicey_](#nimiipuu-l3-274). Besides being an important part of the summer diet, large qualities of roots are prepared for storage in finely coiled basketry and preserved in earthen cache pits for later retrieval. In addition, [cornhusk bags](#nimiipuu-l3-275) were made to collect roots and to store various items. Today [glass jars](#nimiipuu-l3-276) are used to store the prepared roots. For additional discussion on cornhusk bags, see [Contemporary Artists: Continuities]({{ '/culture/artists-continuities.html' | relative_url }})

As the [fishing]({{ '/culture/fisheries.html' | relative_url }}) season is soon to arrive, families also begin to group together in preparation of the larger summer camps. The month of May is called, '_apa_'_ál_, the "Time to dig cous roots." As with the elk hunted and the salmon fished, children were taught not to take the largest root they came upon (or elk or salmon they found). Allow the strongest and largest root or elk or salmon to continue to live so they would help perpetuate the health of all the roots, elk and salmon.

With the summer, _**táyam**_, and the months of _tustimásat_'_al_ "Late season for cous roots" (June), _q_'_oyxc_'_ál_ "Time of blueback salmon at Wallowa Lake" (July), and _waw_'_a_'_máayq_'_ál_ "Chinook salmon to headwater's and spawn" (August), the _Nimíipuu_ are living in large summer camps with an abundance of a variety of foods. Fishing is done along the rivers, with berry gathering and root digging continuing throughout summer. Building scaffolds out over the waters of the rivers and using spears, dip nets, weirs, and hook-and-line methods, the chinook, coho, chum, and sockeye salmon, along with cutthroat and steelhead trout, whitefish, sturgeon and eel, all found in abundance in the rivers and creeks, was an essential component to the _Nimíipuu_ diet. Each year, an individual, on average, would consume over 500 pounds of fish (Walker 1998:420). Salmon could be dried and grounded into a [high-energy powdered meal, called, _tánat_](#nimiipuu-l3-277). A small amount could sustain an individual for several days.

An important teaching associated with fishing called for cleaning the fish along side the rivers and discarding the entrails into the waters. Along with the decomposing of dead salmon each year upon their return from the ocean, the fish entrails added much needed nutrition to the life of the streams.

On October 10th 1805, William Clark wrote in his journal:

> . . . . their amusements appear but few as their situation requires the up most exertion to procure food they are joined in that pursuit, all of the summer and fall fishing for the Salmon, the winter hunting the deer on snowshoes in the plains and taking care of their immense numbers of horses, and the spring cross the mountains to the Missouri to get buffalo robes and meat at to which time they frequent meet with their enemies and lose their horses and many of their people. . . .
