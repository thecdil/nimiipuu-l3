**Ollokot** (_Tewetakis_ - his boyhood name, _Alokat_, refers to a young, male mountain sheep in Nez Perce)

Alokat was born in 18??. He was the son of Tue kas kas and Etoweenonmy. Ollokot later married Tamalwinonmi (heavy rain breaking branches, cloudburst), they had one child, a girl named after her mother, but was called Sarah (later, Sarah Connor). Alokat was a popular leader among the Wel'ewa people, being a noted warrior and statesman. He was an imposing figure, standing six-feet three inches and powerfully built. Alokat took a prominent role in the pre-war meeting that took place at Fort Walla Walla with General Howard on April 20, 1877. He spoke on behalf of the Wel'ewa people against moving from the Wallowa Valley, while Joseph remained back at the disputed homeland, ill. During the Whitebird Battle this celebrated warrior led the largest group of Nez Perce warriors against Perry and his forces, which ultimately resulted in the loss of 1/3 of their command. Later, during the Camas Meadows skirmishes, Alokat led a group of warriors into Howard's camp and captured 100 of their pack mules, thus severely hampering any further movements. Alokat was killed while fighting at the final battle on Snake Creek, near the Bear Paw Mountains on October 4, 1877.
