**The creativity of many contemporary _Nimíipuu_** artists is fundamentally an expression of what their ancestors have sought and accomplished - fusions of traditional styles, patterns and values with new media and forms. _Nimíipuu_ artists have always taken advantage of new media, such as trade cloth and beads, to convey their family's particular designs and values, such as floral and geometric patterns. Artistic expressions is dynamic and fluid, anchored in strands of family traditions yet welcoming new ways to express those values.
