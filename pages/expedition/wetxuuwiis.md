## A Lewis and Clark Perspective
{:.h4}

On September 21st 1805, William Clark mentioned in his journal a "Squar" [squaw], who "had formerly been taken by the Minitarries of the north & Seen white men."

**From the accounts** handed down from the oral history of the _Nimíipuu_, if it had not been for _Wetxuuwíis_ (Wet-k'hoo-wees), the Lewis and Clark would have ended their journey far short of their goal.

After the _Nimíipuu_ had acquired the horse in the 1730s, they began traveling over the Bitterroot Mountains in greater frequency to hunt the buffalo of the northern plains. While they encountered many tribes who remained friendly, other tribes became hostile toward the _Nimíipuu_. On one of these occasions, the _Isq'oykiniz_ (Blackfeet) raided a _Nimíipuu_ camp and captured several young people, including the girl, _Wetxuuwíis_. It was the practice of some tribes to keep "slaves" of their captives. Eventually, _Wetxuuwíis_ was traded to the Mandan but later escaped her captivity. During this time she became acquainted with many "people with light skin," whom the _Nimíipuu_ call, "_soyaapo_," or whiteman. After some time and guided by the "wolf," _Wetxuuwíis_ made her way back among her own people, where she was given the name, "_Wetxuuwíis_," meaning, "the person who returned home."

When the Corps of Discovery first came upon a _Nimíipuu_ village near the _Uyayp_ (Weippe) prairie during the time of _Q'emes_ (camas) harvesting, where there was a great discussion among the people. Just who were these "fool smelling, hairy beasts"? Were they even human - perhaps half human and half animal? Some men said these strangers should be killed. _Nimíipuu_ could have easily killed the men of the Corps of Discovery.

But it was _Wetxuuwíis_, now a respected elder, who stepped forward and spoke of her experiences with the _soyaapos_. She had found the _soyaapos_ be to a "very friendly and considerate people," who had even helped her on her journey home. Her words carried the day and the men of the Lewis and Clark expedition were welcomed, fed and sheltered by the _Nimíipuu_.
