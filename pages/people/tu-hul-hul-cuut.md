**Tu hul hul' cuut'** (_Toolhoolhool zute_, Flathead name which means "Red Mountain")

Tu hul hul'cuut' was the headman of the Piqunin band which resided in the rugged area between the Salmon and Snake Rivers. He was considered a very capable leader from a long line of distinguished warriors, he was also a renowned tewat, or "Indian Doctor." Tu hul hul'cuut's strength was legendary; he was known to carry two Blacktail Deer from where he had killed them back to his lodge. During the council at Lapwai on May 7, 1877, Tu hul hul'cuut' was jailed by General Howard for arguing his strong beliefs, concerning selling his ancestral home lands; he was eventually released. This was one of the determining factors which contributed to the eventual outbreak of the Nez Perce War in June. In the fierce battle at Snake Creek on October 5, 1877, near the Bear Paw Mountains, Tu hul hul'cuut' was killed along with five other individuals at a place known as the "Point of Rocks." They were separated from the main body of warriors while trying to protect the horse herd and were surrounded by a group of soldiers and their Cheyenne scouts.
