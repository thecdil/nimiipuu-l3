**Sam Morris** (_Sik'em Ciicqaanin_, Horse Blanket)

Sam was born near Alpowai, Washington on the Snake River in about 1856. His father was a prominent Nez Perce man by the name of Sik'em Cicqaanin and his mother was a Walla Walla named Awelot or Toyowewinmy. Sam's father was wealthy in cattle and horses, and resided with the Welewa band. Sam was also a brother to Yellow Wolf, both having the same father, but a different mother. During the Nez Perce War of 1877 Sam served as a courier for the U.S. Army during the initial battles in Idaho, while his brother Yellow Wolf, was fighting on the side of the Non-treaty Nez Perce. Later, when the Nez Perce were settled on reservations Sam often held traditional religious, ceremonial, and social events at his home. During these important gatherings he recorded the songs and orations, which took place during these events on his own Edison Machine. On the wax cylinders survived many ancient songs made by or used by the Nez Perce and the history of these songs. It is the only collection from this time period that was recorded by the native subjects themselves, rather than being recorded by anthropologists or ethnologists and has proven to be one of the most significant recordings of Indian people and their music.
