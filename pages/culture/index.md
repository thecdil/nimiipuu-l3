**We are _Nimíipuu_**, "the people"; we are '_Iceyéeyenim mamáy_'_ac_, "children of the Coyote."

William Clark reported that we called ourselves the "Chop pun-nish or Pierced noses." And hence forth the _soyaapos_ (white people) would call us, "the Nez Perce," literally meaning, "pierced noses," though we seldom practiced the custom of piercing our noses.

One of our tribal elders, **Cecil Carter**, tells of a name we had before we had horses, _Cuupn_'_itpel_'_uu_. The name means, we walked out of the woods or walked out of the mountains. It is a very old word.

Some of our southern neighbors, such as the Shoshone and Bannock, called us "people under the tule." It was in reference to the [tule mat-covered]({{ '/items/nimiipuu-l3-043.html' | relative_url }}), long houses we lived in. In addition to the long houses, we covered our [conical tipi-like lodges]({{ '/items/nimiipuu-l3-044.html' | relative_url }}) with tule mats. Tule was a wonderful material to cover our lodges. When wet these reeds would swell to form airtight mats for our winter lodges to keep us warm, then during the summer, air circulated easly through them to cool our lodges.

Our southern neighbors also referred to as "Cous eaters," because of the roots we gathered. One of the principle roots we relied upon was [cous](({{ '/items/nimiipuu-l3-045.html' | relative_url }}). Cous is used for food and medicine.

Whether we call ourselves by the name _Cuupn_'_itpel_'_uu_, Nez Perce, _Nimíipuu_, or '_Iceyéeyenim mamáy_'_ac_, we have been here since time immemorial, traveling [a vast territory]({{ '/culture/territory.html' | relative_url }}). When '_Iceyéeye_, [Coyote, killed the Swallowing Monster near Kamiah]({{ '/culture/coyote.html' | relative_url }}), he sprinkled the blood of the monster upon the earth and a people strong in heart and strong in mind, the _Nimíipuu_, were created.
