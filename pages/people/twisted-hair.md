**Twisted Hair (Wilewmutnin)**

Twisted Hair was the father of Lawyer, who played a prominent role in the history of the Nez Perce people. Twisted Hair was the leader of the people who resided in the Orofino-Ahsahka area. It was Twisted Hair who met the Lewis and Clark Expedition at Weippe on September 20, 1805, as well as on their return trip in 1806. While this critical meeting took place the more prominent leaders were away on a war expedition against the Shoshone, to the south. Because of this, the burden of whether to consider these strange new people as friend or foe, and what was to done after this was determined, fell upon Twisted Hair. With the advice of a woman named Wetxuuwíis (returned) who had been captured by the Blackfeet and then sold to the French-Canadians around the Red-River settlements, the Lewis and Clark expedition were treated as guests.
