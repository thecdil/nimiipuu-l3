# Yvonne LeCornn reads her poem, "Two Feathers in the Wind," in memory of her sister and her sister's half brother. (Interviewed by Ann McCormack, March 2002)

First it was our sister and now it is your son

I really don’t know what to say except I am sorry that they are gone.

I keep asking why this has happened this way

Was it something I did or something I didn’t say?

Some people might call it flat out sin

But not me I prefer to look at it them as two feathers in the wind.

I think way back to the question in my mid that day

Why oh why did she have to go that way?

I don’t understand, please explain this to me

Maybe it was because I was blind and did not see

Was there something that I could have done

Again I heard these questions come

As the tears fall down and the sorrows fills within

We need to remember they two feathers in the wind

Now these two feathers led a beautiful life

Maybe with no husband and no wife

But they survived by their loving parents and Antoinette Cheri

Not to mention their friends and their huge families

So lets remember our stories of our sister and brother

Laugh, cry and embrace each other

Continue to think of them every now and then

Just think of them as two feathers in the wind

The first feather is for our sister Joe Lynn Nadine

Who was honest and quiet, a beautiful queen

She was kind and nice to the people that were nice to her

And to be on her bad side you much not prefer

She had a smile and a laugh to light up the room

And if you ever rode with her, hold off she’s off to the moon

She was a sister and friend but most important a mom

And so it is with Toni her legacy lives on

She was so beautiful and smart and going the right way

Oh how I wish that she could have stayed

So lets continue this story again

To our second feather in the wind

The second feather is for our brother Bobo

I know we’re sad to see him go

But we’ll always have our memories though

So lets remember his greatness and the wonderful man

Who was always quick and willing to lend his hand

He loved to fish and hunt and all that stuff

It wasn’t his size or mean mugs that made him tough

It was because he was a big guy with rosy cheeks

Who would work hard on your car even if it took weeks

And his laugh was big and so was his heart

Everyone here knew that he was smart

He was a son, a brother, uncle and always a true friend to the end

And so now he makes another feather in the wind

So here we are left with sadness and grief

If we hold each other close it could just be brief

Lets not dwell on the lives that are gone

Because within our memories they live on

So lets dry our eyes and muffle our cries

Because deep down we know that everyone dies

So now the feather flies up, up, up in the air

Up past the clouds to those golden stairs

There he will meet his sister once again

Now we have two feathers in the wind.
