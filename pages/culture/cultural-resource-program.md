**The mission of the Cultural Resource Program** is to protect, preserve and perpetuate the cultural resources of the _Nimíipuu_. With its staff, which includes elders, archaeologists, ethnographers, linguists and a director, the program provides recommendations to the other tribal programs concerning effective cultural preservation, and monitors federal compliance of regulations concerning preservation and protection of ancient historic sites and cultural properties on and off tribal lands. The **Circle of Elders**, made up of tribal elders well informed on cultural and historical knowledge, provides indispensable advice and direction for the program. The [cultural property rights agreement]({{ '/culture/cultural-property-rights.html' | relative_url }}) established for the Lewis and Clark Rediscovery Project is but one example of the type of protection and perpetuation sought with cultural resources of the _Nimíipuu_.

Among its many on-going endeavors, the Cultural Resource Program assists the **Leepwey Arts Council** which sponsors workshops and hosts artists throughout the year, helps coordinate the [**_Nimíipuu_ Language Program**]({{ '/culture/language-program.html' | relative_url }}) which offers language instruction for high school, college and community members, in close consultation with elders, provides **research and direction** on a myriad of oral history, archaeological and ethnographic projects, and finally monitors the archaeological and ethnographic preservation of the **Hanford Reservation** in Washington.

It is only through an aggressive and vigilant program of protection, preservation and perpetuation that the rich heritage of the ancestors can be carried forth for the future generations of _Nimíipuu_, as well as to provide to the non-Indian communities an understanding and appreciation of the _Nimíipuu_ way of life.
