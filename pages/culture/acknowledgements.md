**Acknowledgements**. The entire Nez Perce module was conceived and developed by the "Nimíipuu - Lewis and Clark Rediscovery Project Committee." The committee members include [Vera Sonneck](Javascript:openWin('Sites/ShowOneContentContentID560.html','640','480', 'Content')) (co-facilitator), [Allen Pinkham](Javascript:openWin('Sites/ShowOneContentContentID930.html','640','480', 'Content')), [Josiah Pinkham](Javascript:openWin('Sites/ShowOneContentContentID931.html','640','480', 'Content')), [Ann McCormack](Javascript:openWin('Sites/ShowOneContentContentID559.html','640','480', 'Content')), [Nakia Williamson](Javascript:openWin('Sites/ShowOneContentContentID929.html','640','480', 'Content')), Edith Powaukee, Sharon Stevens, [Harold Crook](Javascript:openWin('Sites/ShowOneContentContentID932.html','640','480', 'Content')) and [Rodney Frey](http://www.uidaho.edu/~rfrey) (co-facilitator). Special thanks to Nakia Williamson for writing the biographies and to Edith "Wook" Powaukee for constructing the maps in this module. We also thank Dan Kane and Jason Goldammer of Lewis-Clark State College, Sally Thompson of the University of Montana, and Kenneth Furrow of Furrow Productions for additional video footage. Rodney Frey was responsible for editing video clips, writing initial drafts for many of the web pages, and for the construction of those pages, while Aaron Denham assisted with research and Heather Johnston transcribed the interviews and proof read the module's texts. Thanks goes to Mary Lynn Walker for helping develop several of the educational activities that accompany this module. We also thank the Nez Perce National Historical Park and Robert Applegate for opening their archives to us.

But is was the [**elders** and the other interviewees](ShowOneObjectSiteID34ObjectID302.html) who we are most indebted to and owe our heartfelt thanks. It was their invaluable insights and knowledge that made this project possible. Their guidance and assistance brought "life" to this module.

**Cultural Property**. Before this module was released for public use, it was thoroughly reviewed for its accuracy and appropriateness by the Nimíipuu elders and by the Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee. The [Circle of Elders](ShowOneObjectSiteID34ObjectID89.html) (on March 13, 2002), the Nez Perce Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Committee (on March 14), the Natural Resources Sub-Committee of NPTEC (on March 19), and NPTEC (on March 26) reviewed and approved this module for public educational use. In addition, transcripts of all interviews presented in this module were reviewed and approved by each interviewee. All information in this module, including interviews, maps, texts, and photographs, are the cultural property of the Nez Perce Tribe. See [Cultural Property Rights Agreement](ShowOneObjectSiteID34ObjectID303.html).
