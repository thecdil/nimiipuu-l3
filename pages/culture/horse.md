**By the 1730s** the _Nimíipuu_ had welcomed a new member into their family - the horse. The horse was likely first introduced to the _Nimíipuu_ by their close allies, the Cayuse. With the adoption of the horse the _Nimíipuu_ become even a more mobile people and were able to transport heavier loads. They now frequently traveled across the Bitterroot Mountains to [hunt buffalo](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/L3/ShowOneObjectSiteID30ObjectID125.html) on the northern plains. And with the horse, larger quantities of buffalo robes and meat could be brought back to _Nimíipuu_ country, for example. The journies throughout the Columbia River Basin to trade and fish at such the important intertribal centers as Celilo Falls and Kettle Falls was made much easier. The territory of the seasonal round and the peoples included within it were thus greatly expanded as a result of the horse.

Traveling east among the tribes of the plains, _Nimíipuu_ horses carried such trade items as cakes of camas, dried fish, salmon oil in sealed fish skins, bows of sheep horn, mountain grass hemp. And then upon returning home, those same horses carried dressed buffalo robes, rawhide, buffalo-hide lodge covers, beads, feathered bonnets, and stone pipes. An annual rendezvous with the Flathead, Yakama and Shoshone was held in what would become southwestern Wyoming, for example.

While new trading partnerships flourished, the horse would also bring the _Nimíipuu_ into conflict with many other tribes within their expanded reach, such as with the Blackfeet. Military skills became more important factors in political leadership as a result.

The Cayuse and the _Nimíipuu_ were the only tribes who selectively breed the horse, transforming it into an agile and responsive animal with tremendous endurance to travel great distances. The horse became a source of pride and wealth, of fun and artistic expression, as well as of spiritual power. Some families had herds of over 1,000 horses.
