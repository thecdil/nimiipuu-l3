## A Lewis and Clark Perspective

On September 22nd 1805, William Clark wrote in his journal:

On September 24th 1805, Clark continued:

**After their arduous journey** across the Bitterroots in September of 1805, the Corps of Discovery were welcomed by the _Nimíipuu_ on the Weippe prairie by the local headman, Twisted Hair. William Clark suggested that Twisted Hair was a man of sixty-five years of age and of cheerful spirit.

With chief Broken Arm away fighting the Northern Shoshone, under the direction of Twisted Hair the Corps was fed camas and salmon, and housed. During their stay, maps were drawn up and canoes made in preparation for the river travel to come. Lewis and Clark entrusted Twisted Hair with the care of their horses and cashed their extra supplies with him until their return. It was Twisted Hair who traveled with and helped guide the Corps down the Columbia to the great trading center at Celilo Falls, negotiating with the various tribes they came upon. Upon their return in May of 1806, Lewis and Clark acquired most of their horses back from the care of Twisted Hair.

Before proceeding, the Corps of Discovery camped along the Clearwater, near the confluence with the North Fork of the Clearwater River. As the journey would continue by river, dugout canoes were needed. With their "Small & badly Calculated" axes, the work of cutting, shaping and hollowing five large ponderosa pines began. The effort must have been all that more difficult as many of Lewis and Clark's men were ill and weak from their journey over the Bitterroots. Work on each of the three to four-foot wide logs must have gone very slowly, until the _Nimíipuu_ showed the carpenters how to hollow the logs with a method of burning and chipping. The Corps of Discovery adopted what Sergeant Patrick Gass called, "the Indian method of burning out the canoes." After building a small fire in the area of the log to be hollowed out, the resulting charcoal was then easily chipped out. The process was then repeated, until the desired shape was obtained.

It was during their stay that Sergeant Gass was first to record that the river was abundant "with salmon of an excellent quality" and that the water was "clear as crystal." He also recorded that the captains gave [peace medals](#nimiipuu-l3-012) to "leading men of their nation," Twisted Hair and two un-named "chiefs."

Before launching their new means of travel, Clark made arrangements with Twisted Hair to take care of their thirty-eight horses. Each horse was easily identified, with a brand on its upper left leg reading: "U.S. Capt. M. Lewis." The Corps of Discovery named their camp, "Canoe Camp."
