## Overriding Theme Questions

The following overriding theme questions are posed in this module. Many specific questions will be derived from these key questions, as listed below.

- What is the *Nimíipuu* (Nez Perce) perspective on Lewis and Clark and the Corps of Discovery?
- Given that "Lewis and Clark" have come to symbolize for the *Nimíipuu* a larger historic and on-going relationship with Euro-American society,
    - What is the impact of Euro-American society on the *Nimíipuu* (changes brought after Lewis and Clark)?
    - And equally important, what is the impact of the *Nimíipuu* on Euro-American society?

## *Nimíipuu*: What's in a Name?

1. What does the term *Nimíipuu* mean and what is its origin? What does the term "Nez Perce" mean and how did it come about? What are the significances and differences in the name one calls oneself and in the name others call you?
2. In the larger context, consider the history in which first Lewis and Clark and then other Euro-Americans imposed their terms and names upon the landscape of the *Nimíipuu* and their people. What are the many possible effects and significances of "naming" a river, a mountain, or some other aspect of the landscape, as well as of the use of such terms as "Squar" (squaw)?
3. As used in this module, what does the term "since time immemorial" mean? And what are some of the implications for the *Nimíipuu* in their use of this term?

## History: Disruptions and Continuities

1. What were the major historical events and processes that have had a lasting effect on the *Nimíipuu* way of life?
2. Despite the rather harsh history of Euro-American contact (for example, from the consequences of disease, war and allotment), in what ways have the *Nimíipuu* continued their cultural ways and values into the 21st century? For example, how has *Nimíipuu* involvement with the salmon and the horse in the 19th century continued into the 21st century? What cultural and management practices and values exemplify both eras?
3. What are the legal principles as well as cultural and historical foundations underlying *Nimíipuu* sovereignty? How has that sovereignty been threatened?
4. What were the principle intentions of Lewis and Clark after they crossed over the Bitterroot Mountains into territory the United States had no legal claim? As the lands west of the recently purchased Louisiana Territory were claimed by Britain up until 1846, as part of Canada, what did Jefferson and Lewis and Clark hope to gain by negotiating with the *Nimíipuu*?

## Landscape: Matter of Perspectives

The eyes of Lewis and Clark and the *Nimíipuu* have viewed the same mountains and rivers.

1. Consider the ways Lewis and Clark described the landscape along the Lolo Trail and Clearwater River and, generally, along their entire route to and from the Pacific Ocean. What were they interested in describing and recording in their Journals? What were their purposes in describing the items they recorded?
2. Contrast the Lewis and Clark perspective with how the *Nimíipuu* see their landscape. How is the landscape along the Clearwater River viewed and understood by the *Nimíipuu*? How do the oral traditions, such as those involving Coyote, and spiritual practices contribute to the *Nimíipuu* perspective of the landscape?
3. How have introduction of farming (via the missionary and government programs) and individual land ownership (via the Dawes Act), and such changes as damming the rivers altered how the *Nimíipuu* relate to and use their landscape? In comparing the time of Lewis and Clark with that of today, are there more continuities or discontinuities in *Nimíipuu* worldview?

## *Wetxuuwíis*: Exchanges Between Lewis and Clark and the *Nimíipuu*

1. In what ways did their association with the *Nimíipuu* assist the Corps of Discovery and what did they gain from the association?
2. In what ways did their association with the Lewis and Clark assist the *Nimíipuu* and what did they gain from the association?
3. Were there any negative consequences from the encounter with Lewis and Clark for the *Nimíipuu*?
4. From the perspective of the *Nimíipuu*, what have the Corps of Discovery and Lewis and Clark come to symbolize and represent, and why?
