**Let us take you** through some of the sights and sounds you would experience at a powwow held in _Nimíipuu_ country. You can see a grand entry at the Looking Glass Powwow at Kamiah in August of 2001. You will then move to the _Tutxinmepu_ Powwow, held on the University of Idaho campus in October of 2001, and sponsored by the Native American Student Association of the U of I. The University of Idaho is within the traditional territory of the _Nimíipuu_, ceded in the Treaty of 1863. Besides the types of dances and songs you see and hear on this page, for example, Prairie Chicken, Women's Tradition and Owl dance, many other styles of dance and types of song would also be seen and heard, including Men's Fancy and Grass. On this page, compare some of the songs you hear at the powwow with the Sam Morris songs provided above, for example, Prairie Chicken and Owl. You can also listen to this [honor or chief song]({{ '/items/nimiipuu-l3-140.html' | relative_url }}) recently sung at the White Bird Memorial (Recorded by Antonio Smith, June 1999). You can also listen to this [flag song]({{ '/items/nimiipuu-l3-141.html' | relative_url }}) sung at the Big Hole Memorial in Montana (Recorded by Antonio Smith, August 1999).

Powwows are held throughout the year, and throughout Indian country. They celebrate and reaffirm identity in one's particular tribe and family and in being an Indian. Powwows provide a public way to honor the elders, the veterans, and the children. For so many _Nimíipuu_, to sing and to dance is a deeply spiritual act, a form of prayer and way to give to the Creator. With the particular dance categories, honor takes place and friendly competition and contests are judged for prize money. Powwows are just plain enjoyable, providing an opportunity to renew friendships and to share in a laugh. All peoples, Indian and non-Indian alike, are welcomed and encouraged to share in this vital form of dance and song.

Special recognition is always given to those who have served the country in the armed forces, from the opening flag ceremony, to honor dances for veterans, to this example on one's regalia. The Whip Woman assists in coordinating and instructing more inexperienced dancers and children in proper powwow etiquette.
