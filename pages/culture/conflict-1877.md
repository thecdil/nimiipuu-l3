**What is sometimes** referred to as the "Nez Perce War of 1877," though more accurately called the "Conflict of 1877," actually began long before weapons of war were used. When the [Treaty of 1863 was negotiated]({{ '/culture/treaties.html' | relative_url }}), members of the Wallowa Band in northeast Oregon refused to cede their traditional homelands around Lake Wallowa. Along with other non-Christian bands, they did not take part in signing a treaty that would eliminate their ancestral homelands from the Nez Perce Reservation. After a council with the non-treaty chiefs failed to persuade them to move to the new reservation, Gen. Oliver O. Howard gave a 30-day ultimatum demanding the Indians' prompt "voluntary" relocation. While the non-treaty chiefs such as Joseph, White Bird and Looking Glass made preparations to comply, a handful of young _Nimíipuu_ warriors, seeking retribution for past transgressions, attacked and killed eighteen hostile white settlers living along the Salmon River.

Word of the attack quickly spread to Fort Lapwai and General Howard. Knowing that a successful _Nimíipuu_ uprising could be contagious, General Howard, with no contact or direct knowledge of the situation, sent out 103 men from Fort Lapwai. Howard's goal was to effectively place an end to the killings and provide safety for the white settlers by "silencing" the Indians.

The soldiers first encountered the _Nimíipuu_ at **White Bird**, resulting in the first battle of the Nez Perce conflict. During the battle, the _Nimíipuu_ let it be known that they were a force to be reckoned by defeating a third of General Howard's disorganized army with no losses of their own. After their victory at White Bird on June 17th, the _Nimíipuu_ launched their three month 1,600 mile struggle to find aid and refuge. The war pitted the non-Treaty _Nimíipuu_ bands against a force of 2,000 U.S. Army soldiers, citizen volunteers, and Indians from various tribes. You can listen to this honor or chief song recently sung at the White Bird Memorial (Recorded by Antonio Smith, June 1999).

The three-month, 1,300 mile-long flight took _Nimíipuu_ across the Bitterroot Mountains on the Idaho Montana border, through Yellowstone National Park, then north through Montana. While seeking the help first from the Flathead and then the Crows, the final objective was to find safety with Hunkpapa Sioux Chief Sitting Bull after crossing the U.S. Canada border. Although normally friendly to the _Nimíipuu_, neither the Flathead nor Crows wanted any part in this war. Some 750 non-treaty _Nimíipuu_ were involved, only 250 of them were warriors, the rest were women, children, and elders. After their skillful victory at White Bird, the _Nimíipuu_ and the U.S. Army were involved in five additional battles.

**Clearwater Battle**, July 11-12: Though indecisive, the _Nimíipuu_ forces were strengthened because the warrior Looking Glass and his band joined the fight.

**Big Hole Battle**, August 9: Some 90 _Nimíipuu_ lives were lost in this battle, many of them women and children. Today, the Big Hole battlefield is a National Historical Site. You can listen to this flag song sung recently at the Big Hole Memorial in Montana (Recorded by Antonio Smith, August 1999).

**Camas Meadows Battle**, August 20: The _Nimíipuu_ slowed Howard's advance by stealing some 150 mules in this conflict.

**Canyon Creek Battle**, September 13: Although an Army unit managed to catch up to the _Nimíipuu_, their advance was repelled.

On September 30 at Bear Paw Mountain about 40 miles from the Canadian border, ; a bitter battle ensued and the Indian camp was placed under siege. To save the wounded, women, and children, on October 5, 1877, Chief Joseph formally surrendered with over 400 Nez Perces to General Howard and Colonel Miles.) **Bear Paw Battle**, September 3 to October 5, only about 40 miles from the Canadian border: The _Nimíipuu_ were intercepted by Col. Nelson Miles, with both sides in this final battle sustaining great losses. Being trapped and weary of his people's suffering, on October 5th, Chief Joseph negotiated an end to the fighting and gave his speech that has since become famous, concluding with, "Hear me, my chiefs. I am tired; my heart is sick and sad. From where the sun now stands I will fight no more, forever."

Although some _Nimíipuu_ survivors were able to escape to Canada with Chief White Bird, those that surrendered in hope of returning to Idaho were instead relocated to Oklahoma's Indian Country. Eventually, in 1885 the U.S. government allowed _Nimíipuu_ who had converted to Christianity to return to the reservation at Lapwai, Idaho. Chief Joseph and 150 others, who chose to retain their traditional religion, were exiled to a reservation at Colville, Washington.
