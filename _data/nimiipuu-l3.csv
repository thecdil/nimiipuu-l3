My name is Sam Penney. I am the Chairman of the Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee. I would like to welcome you to the Nez Perce web site as part of the Lewis and Clark Rediscovery Project. I encourage you to review this web site prior to coming to visit us in our country. We welcome you with open arms and hope you find the information on this web site useful.

It will give the tribal perspective regarding the coming of Lewis and Clark in 1805, and the much proud heritage we have as the Nez Perce people.

Again I encourage you to visit the web site, come learn about the Nez Perce people and our way of life, and why we are so proud to be called the Nez Perce people. Thank you and enjoy your visit."

We do have 16 people, counting myself 17 people on staff with a circle of elders. They act as consultants for history, name places, along with the language. We do have a tribal archaeologist and he has a field archaeologist and three technicians and one crew leader. The ethnographer, we have one person working under the ethnographer doing the history part of the Nez Perce and we do have the Hanford cultural people, there is a staff of four. The Hanford Cultural coordinator has two cultural specialists and a Hanford monitor. Most of their work is done over in the Richland area where the clean up area is of the Hanford. Then we do have the language program headed by a language team leader, two coordinators and about three teachers teaching the Nez Perce language program to the adults, young adults, high school as well as the elementary students; also the tribal employees, we are teaching them the language."
nimiipuu-l3-009,Josiah Pinkham interview,2002-03,,"Ethnographer for the Cultural Resource Program, discusses the importance of protecting the material culture for the Nimíipuu.

The importance of material culture isn't something that is more important than another thing. But this is how we remember who we are because there are stories about individuals in our past that we think about when we look at these different things. We need to be surrounded by our old things because it is a real threat to our identity if we were to lose these things. From time to time we have lost significant things from our people. Anything from the old eagle feather headdresses that Joseph used to wear to things such as this. Rocks are important because they were used as tools. They were something that we needed in order to process foods in order to survive. That is a real important concept for our people to remember about our identity and the maintenance of that identity, taking care of it, tending to it, making sure that our children are surrounded by the things that express who we are. That shows them how to think about the world, how to survive in the world. I feel that is something that is really important."
nimiipuu-l3-010,Josiah Pinkham discusses the NAGPRA and ARPA,2002-03,,discusses the NAGPRA (Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act) and ARPA (Archaeological Resource Protection Act Laws associated with protecting the cultural materials of the Nimíipuu. Interviewed by Rodney Frey,https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/L3/Resources/Content/Josiah%20Acts%20256.rm,nimiipuu-l3-010.mp4,video,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/nimiipuu-l3/nimiipuu-l3-010.mp4,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/nimiipuu-l3/thumbs/nimiipuu-l3-010.png,https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/nimiipuu-l3/thumbs/nimiipuu-l3-010.png,"Another aspect of our protection of our cultural identity tends towards the federal laws that have been implemented in the past to help us protect our identity and to do what is right. There is a NAGPRA law that says that people aren't supposed to be in the possession of human remains and that even goes into those agencies that receive federal funding or are federal agencies. For example, different museums that have Nez Perce things are supposed to notify the Nez Perce tribe so the Nez Perce tribe can evaluate the things that they have and a dialogue can commence from that point to figure out whether or not something should come back to the tribe because a lot of these things are important. They do have sacred significance and they are ceremonial and the Nez Perce tribe would like to decide whether or not something should come back so our children can inherit it and take care of it. Thus, remember who they are and basically be taught who they are.

Along the NAGPRA law lies the ARPA law and that is the Archeological Resource Protection Act, which says that it is illegal for people to take archeological artifacts from federal properties and use them for whatever purposes they would like. That is to protect the archeological resource but also the cultural resource that the Nez Perce see. When something has been lying on the ground for a long time that has archeological significance, but more importantly to the Nez Perce that has cultural significance, that has identity with it. It can be expressed to our children that this is not just a rock. This is a tool that is used in processing food so that you can survive in a distinct way. A way of processing food that is different from the way that Europeans process food or the way that Asian people process food. This is something that expresses who we are in this particular area. So it is really important that people realize there are laws to take care of these kinds of things and make sure that they maintain their proper place in the world. We feel that their proper place tends to be with the people that made them because it restores their cultural context. If anybody wants to learn about the Nez Perce they can come to our country and learn about why we do the things that we do. Why do we put plants on our beadwork? It symbolizes our relationship with plants to help us to survive in the world. So that is something that is really important that we take care of."

Now we are branching out to other arenas that are just as valid as archaeological protection. When I got hired on I was asked if I could do these type of really strenuous scientific type illustrations of artifacts and cobbles and various other flakes, projectile points. It is very detailed and very specific type of work. It is the kind of work I like to do but to that level it is almost exhausting because it has to be so near perfect in terms of your dimensions and your scale it has to be as much as possible. Through hit and miss I developed several little techniques I used to make that process go a little smoother and to be a little bit more accurate in terms of the scale and whatever I am representing. That is the kind of work I initially got hired on to do. Again, it kind of brings out another area of my type of draftsmanship that I really don't get to showcase."

Josiah: What's the story behind that? How did that come about?

Beatrice: Well, Wetxuuwiis was taken captive as a little girl, from tribe to tribe. And finally, they sold her and she got to New York, into the Great Lakes area. They kept her there and she learned to speak English and she learned to do a lot of things that the Indian woman did, that the White ladies did, showed her how to cook, make things. And she was finally married to a Frenchman and she had a little boy. And one of her friends told her, “you know he is going to take you over on the big waters and it is a great big water and you go over with him.” He was a Frenchman. “You might never return and you might never come back to this country.” And so she escaped. She made a raft and went over one of the lakes and then hitchhiked.

She knew the wolf. The wolf pack went before her and guided her out west, until she got to, before she got to the Flathead country her little son died; he must have been a little boy, maybe 2 or 3 years old. And so she buried him and then went to the Flathead nation. They were kind of close to us. In fact some of our people were part Flathead. But they practiced that, they used to flatten their head. But the Nez Perces never.

And so she finally come home and they were digging, there used to camp where they dug camas and camp around there. When Lewis and Clark came by there were several little boys playing and they saw them coming and they ran back to camp. And Lewis and Clark followed them. And they got to the camp. By that time Wetxuuwiis was pretty old, and she was laying in her bed in a teepee. And then she heard the commotion and she asked what's happening? They said, “Oh, there are some people here. We've never seen people like that before. They have white faces, but there is one black man, maybe he painted his face black.” He was a colored guy, with Lewis and Clark. (York.) She lifted up her teepee and she looked out and said, “soyaapo.” And we figured that word,“soyaapo,” she got back east because we didn't have it. So she must have been that she learned that back east from some other tribe. Then she heard them say, “What shall we do with them, should we kill them?” After she looked outside and saw them she said, “No don't kill them. They're good people. Saved their lives and they'll give you gifts,” she told them. “They're good people.” And they put down their guns or whatever they had. They didn't kill Lewis and Clark because of her. She came back from the Great Lakes and she lived among them. So they spared their lives because of her telling them, “Don't kill them.” And so Lewis and Clark lived. But several of tribes back along the way said, “They should have killed them.” Even some of the Nez Perce said, “they should have killed them.” But she saved their lives."

The Wetxuuwiis story is so vital and instrumental to the Lewis and Clark Corp of Discovery. Without her they may not have been able to continue. She basically saved their lives with what had happened to her and her experience. It is a heroin, a Nez Perce heroin, that came to the rescue of soyaapo, our soyaapo friends Lewis and Clark and the Corp discovery. Because of her experience when she was captured from the enemy tribe she ended up going back east. Further east she ended up being traded to another tribe until finally she ended up in these great waters, the Great Lakes area where she saw the first soyaapo person, the first white people. She, from our tribe, was the first one to see these different type of people and when she was on her journey back she escaped from this enemy tribe and she made it back all the way to her people, the Nimíipuu. She was able to tell them about these new people to come and that they were as many as there were leaves on a tree and that there were just so many and they had all the fine wealth. With her what happened after that, after she was returned, she was stolen or she was lost and she returned. That is what her name Wetxuuwiis means the one that has been captured or the one that has been lost and then they returned. That is where she gets her name.

So when she shared that story over and over again the people were aware of that story and so when they first encountered Lewis and Clark in 1805 they were familiar with the Wetxuuwiis story. They thought these soyaapo people were creatures, people with eyes blue and green and different type of hair. They thought they were creatures. They didn't know if they should kill them or what they should do with them because they were dangerous or they could be something harmful for the tribe. So when she heard of all this talk it was her that said do them no harm these are the people that treated me well after I was stolen. And so they did, the Nez Perce treated them well, treated them friendly, sent them on their journey, kept their horses for year and were good people to them. And we still are."

What happened there that people might not witness in the journals? Allen: Well I think there are many things. Everybody assumes or the rendition of present history, in history books, assumed that we didn't know that Lewis and Clark were coming, and they assumed we were just waiting along the trail for civilization to come to us. It wasn't that way. We knew that these people existed; that they were a different kind of people. Some of our people even questioned their humanity; you know, “are they human beings?” When we seen them, we compared them to what was, I guess you would call it a prophesy of the coming of these people. They would come to us and among us, speak a language we never heard before, bring with them good things and bad things. And because they didn't look like us, we questioned, “are they were humans.” And then the discussion went on and on and what we finally decided is that they must have some kind of human attribute because they are similar to us even though they have eyes like fish and they smell. And they do give gifts and they are trying to be friendly Knowing this that they we know these people existed, we knew that on the west coast, we knew that there were certain things that had been brought to us from the west coast that was traded inland to us and also from the east. There were many things traded to us from the eastern tribes. And we traveled extensively. How did we know about all these things prior to Lewis and Clark coming? We must have known those things because we traveled through those areas. We knew where the pipestone quarry was in the Great Lakes area. We knew that to the south it was always hot all year long and also to the north it was always cold. So we knew these things even prior to Lewis and Clark, and we were never given credit for knowing these things. And the way these things show up is in the songs that we sing and also in the prophecies and the predictions and the teachings that are told by our elders."

They had already defined who Indian people were at that time. There is one instance that is in the journals and it is right out here at Potlatch creek. They ugh, were there in this village at Potlatch creek. Then what is says in the journal is that this Nez Perce woman came and started giving away all her possessions, giving everything she owned away to the members of the expedition and then she went into incantations or something and she started to sing and babble along or some other thing. Then she slashed herself and passed out. They assumed she went crazy or the implication is that she went crazy in doing this. Well it is called a certain thing that Indian women did at that time and it is a term called 'isxíipit. And what this is, is that you want to increase your knowledge of something or some people or some person and the way to do that is to confront them and make yourself humble and you it's a sixth, I guess you could call it a sixth sense of trying to increase your knowledge of a particular thing or human being. And this is what she was doing and to see if these people were really the people they really said they were. Are they bringing peace, are they bringing these good things to us and are they going to treat us well. This is the kind of thing that she was trying to find out. This is what's carried on, what used to be called medicine dances, and, and this sort of similar activity. This is mostly restricted to what women did. And so they don't interpret it that way, that she just threw a crazy fit and passed out. But there is a certain, there's a reason why she did that.

And case in point would be when Ordway came back in 1806. He went back from Kamiah to, up on the prairie and went to look for salmon in the Salomon River. He couldn't find any so he went down to the Snake River, probably through, near Winchester now, and then he went on down to the Snake River, and there he found some salmon, and so he traded and purchased salmon down there. And what occurred the night before he was to come back to Kamiah, bringing salmon with him, he made a note in his journal that the Nez Perce stole salmon from him the night before. So not realizing that there were other things going on in that village where he purchased the salmon, that there is a salmon leader, what we called a “salmon leader” and what the responsibility of the salmon leader was to distribute salmon to all people and to make sure that when they catch the salmon that it is well distributed among all the members of the village people and all the guests. Well I think this is what occurred, that the salmon leader took back some of the salmon that was traded or sold to Ordway, and redistributed to a family or other tribal members that didn't have salmon. But Ordway noted in his journal that fish were stolen; so this is a misunderstanding. And because Ordway and others that were with him couldn't speak Nez Perce and they couldn't convey in sign language what this salmon leader did, it was written in Ordway's journal that the salmon were stolen.

But two Americans did lead a party into the bleakness, setting down the facts of the wilderness, binding the continent from ocean to ocean with the truth. These leaders were Meriweather Lewis and William Clark. Together they unveiled America's destiny. It is together that we remember Lewis and Clark, for together they unveiled America's destiny and strengthened the claim of the United States to the Pacific Northwest. Neither could have done it alone."

They were signers of the treaty. Everybody was up to Weeppe digging camas. The women were out and the men either were fixing their arrows, bows and arrows or else they were fixing their fishing nets. So they went out on the prairie, kind of going up from where Lawyer camped and going up they saw something coming. They said, “Looks like buffalo,” because they had looked like hair, beards. They thought it was buffalo, “Is that buffalo? No.” So they sneaked along the creek and along the bushes and they saw they were men. Lawyer said we better go back and tell.

They went back to Twisted Hairs camp. He told them that we see some people coming and we don't know who they are but they got long whiskers. Twisted Hair said, “You go this way, you go that way, you go this way and tell the men to come.”

So they all come and they were talking about it. One of them said, “Lets kill them, there is more of us.” North Dakota were about 30 men or less maybe. He said, “We will kill them.” When the women told her about it she send word to Twisted Hair, “Don't kill them. Those kind of people were good to me when I was coming alone. They gave me food to eat and a place to sleep.” She came all alone by herself to Weippe country. So they honored a sick woman, they knew she was going to die and they honored her wish. They didn't kill them. They took them in.

Dad's grandmother told him that Lawyer always said, they were little boys and all the men were in this big two-fire teepee and they crawled under on their bellies. You know how they roll their tents up when it is hot weather and they crawled under the feet of some of those men because you know how you sit cross-legged and they crawled under where their knees are and they looked and were listening to what they were talking about, what they were going to do with these people. They gave them a place to sleep and they had camas. And of course they got fish from the creek and the river. They'd go down to the ""big river"" in Seine (to dip net fish). So they took care of them.

Those men were hungry. You could really get by with one or two camas and that is all you are supposed to eat but those men were hungry. They just filled up with everything, with camas. They all got belly aches. That is when Clark started in on Dr. Rush's pills. You read it in the diary how he give them those pills because they all had the runs. Camas can make you sick if you eat a lot of it."

And it would have happened sooner or later based upon prophecies and predictions about what were going to occur, the advent of soyaapo and the advent of society, and different things. We have had a lot of things happen to us that probably were more negative and so irrespective of the things that we are standing for today, for example, the things we have contributed to, it has been to the detriment of our people.

And so I would look at it as a very negative impact on the survival of our people, the lifestyle, and the cultural conditions. We as a society, where we were at that point and time, which was something that we were very much at peace and harmony with the world about us; ecosystems were in place. We were helping to nurture that ecosystem survival the way that we knew how. Then what they call “the Corp of Discovery,” when that came about that drastically altered and changed that environment forever. And so today we have lost a lot of things.

And so I look back at everything that has happened. The advent of society, “civilization,” the advent of the culture and the languages that have overwhelmed our people, Christianity and the churches, all those things that have been tad amount to ethnocide, genocide. All those things have been kind where someone else's destiny has been manifested upon the ills of our people. So I have no other choice but to say that I am one of the leading proponents of the fact that the impacts on the Nez Perce people, the Nimíipuu, put it that way, have been as a result of the support of the Lewis and Clark expedition. We probably would have been better off if we would have eliminated them. Put it that way."

Beatrice Miles: Well they didn't like it, the older Indians and some of the young ones still go along with it. They didn't like the fact that through that coming out west they made a trail for white people to come. And they treated us so bad. According to McWhorter story there was a man riding his horse up by Sweetwater and a white man shot him off his horse. They said that then they drove our Indian people in 1877 out of their own country while Chief Joseph was there."

In the history of the making of this country there were no right or wrong we were all a part of it and we all need to be proud of who we are and where we come from. . . . I've brought my children here (Big Hole Battle Site) for at least the last 10 years and the reason I do that is because I want them to have a strong sense of who they are and have a lot of value about being Nez Perce because a lot of times Indians are portrayed in a very negative light, in a negative way. So by bringing them here they can see that there was a sacrifice made for their life and they do have a responsibility to their friends, to their relatives, and to their family. They are influenced by a lot of things, by T.V., by drugs, by alcohol, by a lot of things that aren't a part of our culture and they need to live in both worlds. Bur they need to be responsible for their decisions and responsible for making good decisions because it reflects on all of us. We give our children Nez Perce names, all my children have their names now so that when they go to the Creator they will recognize them by their Indian name. And it is just a part of learning and growing so that when they have children of their own they can carry that forward. They will have something to teach their children in the next generation."

It has been a sovereign nation since time immemorial. Before any treaties, before the United States, before Lewis and Clark the Tribe functioned had a government and was a sovereign nation and conducted relations and trades with other sovereign tribes within the area now known as the United States. That is where we start. That sovereignty was recognized by the United States in 1855 when a treaty was entered between this nation and the Nez Perce Tribe. That treaty recognized a territory for the Tribe and it is important to remember that treaty rights aren't something the United State gave to the Tribe. The Nez Perce Tribe in that treaty reserved certain rights to themselves. They reserved the land, they reserved fishing rights, they reserved hunting rights, they reserved rights to gather and graze horses and cattle both within the reservation and outside the reservation. That is where the sovereignty was recognized and since 1855 the Supreme Court and other courts of this nation have recognized treaty rights and the treaty as being the source of sovereignty. That is our legal foundation when we go to any forum that is where we start as far as asserting the sovereignty of the Tribe."

Probably the biggest group of those cases has to deal with natural resources, specifically salmon because the Tribe since time immemorial depended on salmon for cultural, religious and other purposes. These cases include litigation against the United States Army Corps of Engineers for the operation of the four dams on the lower Snake River. These dams back up water and make the water very hot and actually violate water quality standards in the state of Washington that are part of the Clean Water Act.

So the Tribe filed a lawsuit with some other organizations basically to require the Army Corps to meet these water quality standards, like anyone else would need to. Any other citizen or anyone else operating a dam would also need to meet those water quality standards. That is one case. Another case is called the Snake River Basin Adjudication. That is a water rights case. In that case the Tribe has claimed water rights that are necessary to protect fish. Essentially those treaty rights to fish would be meaningless unless there was water to have fish there. That is another case the tribe is involved.

Other cases the Tribe is involved in there is litigation going on right now over protection of roadless areas in National Forests. Much of the former territory of the Nez Perce Tribe is within National Forests in Idaho, Washington, Oregon, and Montana and those areas much of it is not developed to this day and have no roads and are relatively pristine. This current litigation examines whether or not rules that were promulgated by President Clinton are legal or not. The Tribe has supported those rules. It is important for the Tribe to have that habitat in tact for fish, to protect cultural resources of the Tribe, to protect wildlife and berries and other roots that the Tribe gathers. So the Tribe is involved in that lawsuit.

In addition the Tribe is involved in several other lawsuits against the United States, all related to salmon recovery. The National Marine Fisheries Service who is charge of protecting salmon and steelhead in the Columbia Basin issued a recovery plan, which is called a biological opinion. The Tribe feels that the biological opinion isn't sufficient enough to meet the goals of protecting salmon and steelhead. That it is not going to recover these species to a level that is going to prevent extinction and further that it is not going to recover species in a level that is necessary for the Tribe to exercise its treaty rights. It is important to remember that in order for those treaty rights to be meaningful there needs to be enough fish for the tribe and other people to harvest. So it is more than just preventing extinction, it is making sure that there is a healthy run of fish like there were when Lewis and Clark came."

Now those are areas that are both within the Reservation, they are within the areas the Tribe had exclusive occupation over before the treaty, as well as areas outside of that. For example, the Tribe's usual and accustomed fishing areas extend all the way to Portland. There are important fisheries there for lamprey eels and other fish; all along the Columbia River, throughout the state of Idaho and even into Montana. As opposed the treaty right to hunt, gather and graze that is described as open and unclaimed lands. Open and unclaimed lands have been interpreted by the court as being lands that are not privately held, forest service lands, BLM lands, lands that are owned by the government, by the federal or state government.

The Nez Perce Tribe's treaty is unique in that at the treaty minutes the chiefs asked, “Could we go to buffalo country and exercise these hunting rights?” Governor Stevens who negotiated the treaty on behalf of the United States said, “Yes, you can go to buffalo country.” Buffalo country was the area around Yellowstone in Montana and Wyoming. So even the hunting rights of the Nez Perce Tribe can extend outside of those areas that the Tribe had exclusive occupation over. But again it would have to be open and unclaimed lands within that are, so federal or state lands within that area."

Why is that important; how would you explain that as being important? Leroy: Well, you have different fish in the water. You have a sucker, you have a squaw fish, you have a trout, you have a bass, you have all these. If they all started cross breeding and borrowing from each other the next thing you'd know is they would all look like one fish. Well you talk about Pan-Indianism; that's kind of a simple analogy. If you had all of our people of this world start borrowing other people's things and they all start doing the same thing there would be no unique individuals anymore. All the same and that is why I think we should keep our own things and do what we do so we can be recognized for what we do. Everything from the horses to the way we dance, the way we talk, our language, the way we dress, or whatever it is. I think that is important. Otherwise it will be lost in the big old sea of everybody."

They'd all conquer a project together. It wasn't like one person struggling to get it done. A lot of them jumped in and said, “Well, I'll do this.” They kind of did their own little additions to each project, which helped. This we carry on with my sister and my brothers. When they have a project they ask for help and we all jump in to conquer that project. Most of these projects as I've grown up there is not just one person working on them. There is my aunt, me, my mom, and as my sister got older my sister started adding things. Each piece is added even after years have gone by. This is actually taken from an old piece that my grandmother gave me when I was little. I was only like 4 or 5 when I got the leggings and the moccasins and hair ties. That was probably my first pieces. I've got the leggings in here but I had to redo them because through the years they have gotten really worn. But these are really old; they are probably older than I am. This design has come from my grandmother, one of her designs she did. What I did was remounted it, put it on new buckskin and then added more edging. This is some of my work up here. I kind of refurbished an old piece and make it usable again and then keep my grandmother's work going. This is how it goes. Our ladies would wear the ties on the side. A lot of these women nowadays they wear the ties on the inside but our women didn't wear them like that. There are a lot of reasons to that. Number one our women were horse riders and if you wear your legging on this way you'll get hung up on something for sure and probably drug. That is why they are worn this way. They are usually tied but with today's new inventions and what not you got the Velcro. I added that, that is not an old idea. It is pretty new stuff but I always put the ties on it just in case because as you dance it may come undone. You can't always rely on soyaapo. You always have to go back to your old buckskin."

And doing different designs, different shapes. Then using the cornhusk where it is altogether. This is just sort of a plain, twiney and twisty and this is cornhusk, it lays different. This is cornhusk and when I started getting back into cornhusk this is what my mother kept wanting me to do because she figured I'd be the only one to do it. My sisters don't get involved with this stuff. She took me to visit with Katherine Ramsey and Katherine was filling me in. She brought out all her bags, she showed me and I was just astound at how much work she had done. She was telling me how the cornhusk was done. When you take the cornhusk you take the inner husk from the corn. You don't use the outside because it is too rough and too thick. But the inner cornhusk is what you take and you can put a string through it and tie it up to bleach it during the summertime. When you do a weaving you'll slice just a small, small piece like that and then it will naturally be wet. It'll be wet and then you'll just wrap it around your string here, your twine. It'll be just a twist around, then you just twist it and twine it in there. This is a big project; it is going to take a long time.

Now this one it just sort of came together. I started with just a plain color and then I used a corrugated, which gives a natural design as you are weaving it up. Then I got up here and just started adding my cornhusk to it. Then I added the cedar; this is died yellow cedar and red cedar. I put that in there. Most of my work I have more or less tried, since I started with cedar, I tried to put cedar into my bags, whether it is cornhusk. So I have used yellow cedar in these and also the regular yarn but I always try to keep some parts Nez Perce."

We did a talent show there and a lot of Indian people in the community came out and participated. I knew that back at home we have several talented people that could do all kinds of different things that I wanted to help expose.

I did do some type of talent show in 1991 at Lewiston high school. It was a real fun night. People came out, they sang, they danced, and did all kinds of different little talents. We have so much talent here in this small little community and I just think it is so amazing. Some of the talents people have come from their culture. Their talents in their weaving, their drumming, their singing and their dancing all comes from our traditional culture. Some of the talents they have maybe kind of turned a little more contemporary but it is what they were born with.

To come back here and see that there was an arts council gave me the opportunity to work on different projects to help expose other people who are artists who have talents, to expose their talents to the community. What it did for me is it helped expose some of what I am working on, my talents, it helped me create myself better as an artist, as a writer, as an actor and so I have been able to do that with playwriting."

There is still a lot of admiration for the way our people did things a long time ago. We do our best to still carry on and conduct those same ways. This one is actually from a piece of téhey. Téhey was a trade cloth and trade cloth was sought after because of this white border that was on it. It is a real interesting process that they used to utilize in making the trade cloth. The Nez Perce didn't make trade cloth but they traded for it and it was traded into our people. They always liked this little white border that was on it. The way that it is prepared is that you put a piece of canvas over this and you sew it so that it makes a sturdy edge or there were a few different reasons why they did this. That is why it is purple on the bottom side right here, because it was curled under like that and then sewed and then it is dipped into dye. Other people across the world they would take and cut that off but the Nez Perce were quite fond of that. Nez Perce and other Plateau nations, even other nations down throughout the United States. They really admired that and so it was left on."

She'd tan maybe one or two hides. We'd go down there and then she'd want me to either scrape the hair off or stretch it or soften it or something like that. I would do that for her. That is where I picked it up.

Once that hair starts to fall off and it's in the water long enough you can take your hand and take that hair off. It'll come right off real good. I usually try to wait until the hair will come off like that before you monkey with it because you can take the hair off of a hide in about 15-20 minutes, if you go like a bat out of hell. If you just take your time about it maybe it would take you a half an hour or so to take the hair off. Then get a couple of you to stretch it out and nail it down to dry.

This one is a spider, a spider design on it. And this design on this side over here I think is part of the swallow, part of the swallow design.

This is my knife case. We carried knives during World War II.

This is a teepee bag I use on horses. This is a bonnet case that I made. That is also used on a horse. I've got the old style trade bells on there.

The way that these were made a long time ago is they would take the hide and while it was still wet they would stake it down in the ground with the first side down and the ladies would tediously free hand the designs onto the hide with different paints. There would be earth oakers and then they would cover it with another layer of, like hide glue, to protect that surface. Then it was turned over and the hair was pounded off from it and it would make this rawhide area around here a little bit white. This one here isn't pounded so you can see through it a little bit. You can see that it has got the dark material behind it but that is how they would prepare those and it would take a lot of time.

That is what we call 'isáaptakay. The skins that were used for transporting different things to different areas and often times those were used in ceremonies and trading foods such as this to different family members or different individuals. They would take a whole bunch or different dried foods that they had and they would put them into these skins. That was like a unit of trade. One 'isáaptakay for maybe a blanket or something like that and they would just go back and forth."

That is where I got involved with beadwork and various other means of producing items. A lot of my beadwork is like the designs on this vest. It is kind of really my first beaded outfit. It is based on a set of horse trackings that were in our family and so a lot of the designs are based on that traditional item that was used for another purpose. Again, I took that traditional item that was used for another purpose and I transformed it into something that was a little bit more contemporary and used for my purpose. I used the real modern cuts of beads, the trycuts. Unfortunately a lot of the early colors that were used by our people, the old Italian beads that were used and they were so, the depth of the beads were so great because of the natural pigments that they used in producing the beads that are unfortunately no longer. I had to substitute for modern colors and what not. That is where you get a lot and plus the sparkle it is kind of, when you are dancing in contest type of dancing it really makes you stand out.

I was also told by some of my people who I rely upon for advice and knowledge that sparkly things are always favored by Plateau people. It has the connection to traditional beliefs and religious beliefs as well. The sparkly things have, just the same as mirrors, they have a tendency to shine back anything that might be negative. Again that goes back to the dance and the strength that you have to have and that you have to exhibit when you dance because a lot of people are watching you and not all of them are thinking positive thoughts towards you for whatever reason. So it is important to have these things made in a certain way. This is done in, you can tell, geometric work. It is reminiscent of Nez Perce geometric designs. Often times it closely resembles the work that is done out in the Plains by the Crows. It often is confused but there are some subtle differences that our work has that theirs doesn't, as well theirs does that ours doesn't have."

This comes from the legend of Ant the Yellow Jacket. This one is tilípe- fox and this one is 'iceyéeye- coyote. And, coyote is known as trickster coyote and he is magical and mystical and he can do a lot of good but he can also get into trouble. And Tliupa is a lot of times his sidekick. And so, these are some of the masks. Once the kids put these on, like Trickster being magical and mystical, once they put them on it almost seems like they transform into that character. So, it may give them some type of comfort to hide behind and at the same time they become born into these characters.

Ann (in background): You played Coyote in the last production, can you put on the mask for a minuet and let us see what it looks like when a human being is wearing it?

(Angel with the mask on): Manáa kúuse? What are you doing? Ohhhhh Láawtiiwa Not you again.

So we just throw in Nez Perce language words in there. This is the mask and once you put on the mask you realize coyote is feisty and jumpy and so to be trickster coyote, 'iceyéeye you kind of have to try and get in shape too, because he is everywhere and that is what this character is. You can't play trickster coyote uhhhhhohhh, that just wouldn't work this is, coyote is kind of hyper. So, that is what I turned him into anyway and that is what the mask made me do, is turn into an energetic 'iceyéeye."

One was with Dolores Churchill. She is a famous Haida basket maker from up there. She showed me different techniques and also using cedar, it is the tree of life and when you collect the bark you almost have to say a prayer to the tree and thank the tree for it. The tree was the tree of life because it provided the canoes, it provided their shelter, and it provided their clothing. She said you can make diapers with cedar. It was everything. I worked mostly with cedar, red cedar and yellow cedar and going out and gathering my own. I have been going to different reservations. I took another class with Ana Jefferson and we went out and gathered cedar up in Mt. Baker. That was a neat experience too, to go up in the mountains. You could just feel the trees talking to you and you go out there and start gathering bark. You'll see trees that when you take the bark from a long time ago, it is just starting to barely grow back to where it was taken from. You think about how many women were out there along time ago gathering bark and doing baskets."

I have another basket that I worked with too that Dolores had showed me how to work with, but the grass up there is sort of different from down here and you have to gather it at different times. Red cedar you can find a lot down here but yellow cedar, there is no red cedar around here. In the lower half of the U.S. it is all gone. Alaska has a lot; you have to go to Alaska or up north to the British Columbia. Maidenhair fern, you can find maidenhair fern because I found it up towards Kamiah and Kooskia. In fact I found some cedar trees, which I already gathered up there. I will make another trip up there this spring."

That is where we started with trying to bring some of the Nez Perce legends out. And from that, working with the language program and also with the Nez Perce Arts Council, with the culture camp coming up what we started to do was we wanted to have storytelling time for culture camp because that is part of our traditional ways, to tell the stories, to tell the legends. A lot of these kids have not been exposed to the legends; they haven't heard them before. That gave us an opportunity to tell our stories, tell the legends, to teach these kids the legends so they will learn them and know them and they will pass them on.

Through drama, to get them involved. Once they are involved they will know it even better because they will be experiencing in it, they will be living it as coyote, as the ant and the yellow jacket. They will get to become these characters. And so we put these legends into script for them so the kids at the culture camp can be involved as actors.

Through using the Nez Perce language words so that not only are they learning the stories they are learning the language as well. It has been a fun part of our camp to gather with these kids and separate them into their different groups with their different counselors and to have them become these characters. It has been really entertaining for not only the kids but for us as adults as well to see them open up and become a real funny coyote. Walking around camp they may seem kind of shy but it gives them a chance to shine on that night. Those kids they know those stories now and we continue to do those every year. To retell and retell the stories, learn the stories and keep the tradition going. I think it is has been a good learning tool for the kids."

It just comes to me and I don't know. I'll just be sitting there and it is usually like I'll be writing a letter to somebody. Then after I get done writing I don't know what kind of mind frame I was in but I just start writing about whatever I think is important to me, important that I think people need to hear. What drives me nuts is that people that write songs and they write these song and they don't really have any meaning, no real words of knowledge. That is something that really needs to be opened up more. I think a lot more people are starting to now but in the past 10 years rap was just getting up there and hey, hey, not really spitting out some knowledge that people can use to help guide them in the right way because people feel a certain way but they don't go that way because they don't have somebody to help them see that it is o.k. which ever way you decide to go. It's o.k. if that's what you want you know.

One of the other things I like to do is write poems for people that have lost people that I know can use a good ear, some good words to help them heal. It is what helps me, too. I've been trying to get more into talking about the land issues and our roots; preserving our roots, preserving our fishing rights and things like that. Trying to work that in too, I want to work it into my music because my friend we are going to kind of get something going here. We'll make a tape and hopefully it will do all right.

My mom and dad have a horse herd of appaloosa, raise appaloosas and we have a big horse herd. I really love to ride horses and in many of my pieces that is what you will see, a horse. To the left is a Native American on horseback and he is in the mountains and he is welcoming the basketball into his life. It is kind of story of Native Americans playing hoop, how basketball is such a big part of our lives. I see basketball as a real good outlet, a good way to express yourself and be who you are. Traveling to tournaments and doing all that, getting to know your brothers, your friends more on a basis like that is really good. I see this as looking at how in present day we are welcoming basketball into our lives as an outlet from other things that you could do but to stay on the right path and follow that path into basketball. That is more where that one is going. It is kind of an abstraction so the average person would have to look a little closer to see just what I am trying to say, but a person who knows basketball and plays would just pick that up right away.

The other one behind me I have just started and that is actually I took that from a picture of my uncle Irvin Waters that I was talking about earlier, uncle Irvin Waters. He is really important in my life as far as when I was younger. I'd go riding in a rig with my dad and Irvin and he taught us the Native American language when I was real young and the music. That is really important to me. He was always there for us and I wanted to put him on there in one of my pieces and show what the Native American people are or what he has kind of instilled in me. Some of the words like pride and heritage and family, all them words are in my paintings somewhere. In this painting especially because I wanted to get across that those are the things that are important to me as a Nez Perce. He is carrying a flag, which I thought was kind of that representation that Native Americans are proud to be Americans and they are proud to be who they are. He actually fount in World War II I think it is in the navy and so he's real proud to be Native American and American. I wanted to get that across to maybe people that don't know that Native Americans are real proud of who they are. They got both sides but they are really proud to be Americans. So that kind of came across and of course the horse, I got to put a horse in there every time."

A lot of them were floral, and there was geometric as well, but the time period where a lot of these things came from were the time period where a lot of floral was coming into vogue around here. So this is one of my latest ones I have been working on. It is going to be kind of like a whole new outfit. It is just the beginning. One side of the cuff with floral designs that are really typical of the Cloud family and the Dixon family, especially this type of design right here. Again it is based on traditional, it is derived from a traditional source but it is altered. It is very much uniquely mine, my creation.

One art form or one creation or one medium kind of plays into another. It has really been an idea that I have really expounded upon because here in my piece I really rely heavily on colors that were first created in beads in 19th century beadwork that the Nez Perce were very widely known for. I use a lot of the color combinations that are reminiscent of beadwork, especially from our family. Again, I really get influenced by their color, their choice, their palate and the way natural tones are able to be combined with seemingly unnatural, and complex color combinations where you are juggling 5, 6, up to 9 colors and somehow it does not become a jumbled mess.

I think the color combinations of people here on the Plateau as well in other areas were very widely developed. I think a lot of credit has not really been given to that fact. I really try to stress in my work having that connection with the materials, with color and line and form. It is really important. In my work you will see things that are reminiscent of beadwork, corn husk work, parfleche painting, 'isáaptakay and various other elements. I like to combine and try to make it a piece that speaks to each one of the diverse meanings that people used to work with and combine them in a new contemporary form that obviously this is. I think again it is just a continuation of what the people, the creativity of the people exhibited years upon years ago.

Again, I try to add that bit of creativity. The kind of choices that really make something stand out that our people were known for. For instance, the hair or various other things I substitute dark blue or cobalt blue as opposed to using black because black is almost seen as a disruptive color to a lot of the color combinations in terms of beadwork. It is found in certain forms but in the kind of color combinations I am interested in it is almost nonexistent. It is a lot more powerful that way and not as predictable I guess.

The typical floral designs and typical geometric designs that are from this area, it is kind of fun to play around with all the colors and shapes. Combining hard geometric shapes with real curvaceous floral, kind of arrangement type of things with animals, pictographs drawings and stuff. That is the kind of thing I like to do combine all kinds of contrasting shapes and colors, forms."

We count that as a married couple counting as one and another married couple is one but we've also used it if you get both married couples up you get three points. If you have a male up, like this one over here is red, and you have the blue female up that is nothing; they are not married; they are not together. So it has to be the blue and the red here or a matching color of some sort. Whatever colors they've been painted to match, they must show up like that. The blue couple and the red couple over here.

There are other points and scores that you could probably throw in there. For example, one of the things we do sometimes is to have a two in there and that is where there would be a man and two women and in Nez Perce that is called hicqóynise. That means if two men are comrades and they go off to battle and one of them is killed then the one that is alive will come back and take care of the deceased's wife and children so they'll have a better chance of surviving through the winter or whatever it is. Men and women are so dependent on each other and I guess that is one interesting cultural bit of information that relates to this game as well.

This is cá'ya nothing. This is cá'ya takes all your points away, absolutely nothing."

She was talking about one of the stories that she learned from Tatay was that when he was just little, he must have been like five years old or something like that, just a little boy. She said that he still remembers when Tatay would come and get him up in the morning and he would tell him go down there and jump in the river now, go down there and break the ice and bathe because we got a long day ahead of us. He would do it. He would go down there and break the ice, jump in, wash himself up and then he'd get out and run all the way back up to the teepee and said that by the time he would get back to the teepee his brains were just ice, solid ice. That just shows the discipline that even the real young children had at that time and confronting basically the fear of cold water.

Leroy: Yeah I know that is all true because that is what my uncle did to, my Uncle Howard Davis did to Del, my brother and I. I know I told the story I don't know how many times but it is one of the best lessons I've had in life and it has given me strength mentally, physically. I am not afraid of winter because of that, and that is really a strong, it is a powerful gift. It makes you more of a friend or an ally or whatever you want to call it, a part, it brings you close to Mother Earth that way. Yeah, someone could tell me right now to go down and break the ice and jump in and there's no problem. There's no question, you don't even think about it. It is what we had to do. When we were younger, 9 and 7 or something like that, they took us down there early in the morning and it was kind of dark and you had to break up the ice like that. He says I am going to go in and you boys come in after I get out. He got out so we got in there and you have to move those big clumps of ice around because they always come back you know if you don't have a place to push them. So when we got out he told us to dry off real quick so we could run back up to the house. That is the way our hair was, too, little icicles. You could here them as you were running, clink, clink, clink, clink. I haven't done that to my grandsons but I did that to my son at Yellowstone River."

It is all torn down now and across over there under that tree there was a bench. The men on Saturdays Lapwai would be full of people if you could believe it. People would be going up and down the streets. The farmers' wives would be doing their shopping and the Indian women would be doing their shopping. There were a bunch of the them sitting there and dad was sitting there with them and they were talking and telling stories, laughing and stuff. Star J. Maxwell came along. He was a dignified minister to the Methodist church and he was justice of peace and he was a rotary public and he wore thick glasses. They were all talking, laughing and he come and everybody “ta ' c méeywi”, glad to see you and all that. Dad said “You know why Jake,” his nickname was Jake, “you know why Jake Maxwell wears those glasses, the real thick, thick glasses with the circles? You know why he wears those?” They said, “No why?” “He can see through women's clothes. That is why he wears them all the time.” Jake said “Oh Corbett that is not true, don't say that.” He said, “Well look at those women,” and sure enough there was Nancy Halfmoon, Esther Jackson's mother, and Matilda Levi walking along. They were kind of walking sideways. Seeing how they are they don't want him to look at them. Everybody laughed like everything and then it was quiet.

One of the men said, “Jake let me borrow your glasses.” I never did forget that and when I had to make speeches every once in awhile I'd use that because I thought that was the funniest darn thing. I learned so much from my parents."

It is very brief and to the point and no long stories involved. One of the best examples I can think of is when my brother and I were racing. We had a foot race with our grandfather. He was older than us and he knew we could possibly beat him so he'd have to get himself a few paces ahead of us at the starting line. Then we'd say go and then he'd beat us because he was a little closer to the finish line and after we'd get finished he'd say, “You boys run like a dry creek.” It's a little bit of Nez Perce humor.

That is kind of one of the ways I view humor. There was a lot of humor in the old days and humor these days. It is kind of like medicine to me. Since we all live together I mix them. Like the old people say if you find something along the road that is good then pick it up and use it. If not then it is their choice but it is there."

All within the circle. A good dancer can do that without having to go all over the floor. That is what he'd say. I used to watch him and I never could, it is hard to believe the movements that he could do, he was kind of like a contortionist. Of course, my young mind at the time it was hard to walk and chew gum at the same time but here he was moving one leg this way and the other one up the other way and toe going this way and arm going here and his head this way and he's bopping around his shoulders. Everything was all moving just like instead of one body it was like he had three or four bodies in one just all moving, literally like a plastic man. He was fun to watch. He was very fluid."

We've suppressed fire for a little over a hundred years now. And, Now do to all these issues arise of what does it mean to be a steward of the land and how does fire play a major role. We already know that, ya know from our culture, from our oral histories that the Nez Perce burned quite frequently the land. Three to five year intervals, deliberate fires, ya know because that provided our sustenance and really leading into our spirituality. So, now Americans are finally beginning to grapple and understand what that really means. What does it mean the connection of the land? And so, fire we've known as an important part, a management tool and now scientifically it is, but culturally it has always been there. But, for congress to finally understand after houses get burned down, or you know, how do we manage our landscape in a way that, uhm, best suits us? The things that they are finding out we've already known. They didn't have to go learn, they didn't have to run through the dark forests and run into trees left and right. They could have just turned to their neighbor, us, and asked us what we thought rather than running over 120 years of suppression."

We've been involved with wolf recovery since 1995. The state of Idaho did not want to touch the wolf recovery. When you look at wolves, the icon of the wolf is that you have the American flag behind it when you look at it and you see, you see restoration and that sort of the thing from the Indian point of view. But, uhm the way the ranchers and farmers see it, is that it is a detriment to their businesses and so you see opposition from them regarding wolf recovery. In knowing the Indian way, the wolf had its place here before the farmers and ranchers were here. They had their place with us as the Nez Perce people. So us being involved with wolf recovery has been not only a scientific management regime but also a cultural significance to us in that himiin is back with us. And uhm, these are the, this is one of the predators that the Nez Perce highly regard as equal status to human beings or actually we are probably lower status than them because the Indian way is that the creatures were here, the animals were here before us. We come in as a weaker, lesser animal when the Hanyawáat, the creator put us here so we actually have a submissive status to the animals that have already have been here way longer than us as Nez Perce people."

If you are talking one on one, micíi', you listen. Wáaqo, now I am going to talk to you.

But that way a long time ago if your parents thought you was getting out of hand, they'd call someone to come and talk to you. They would sit you there and this man would talk to you and tell you, ""listen to what your parents say because they are not telling you this to get mad at you. They love you for who you are and they don't want to grow up being bad.""

Anytime you was being disciplined for anything, weet'u 'ee, don't answer back. 'Iméewyecoyetkalayko, that is a big word, it is an old word. I think the word for that in English was don't sass back.

Nowadays we call it Powwow. They get dressed up in their fine regalia. We have different things that are more modern in nature. This is a vest that I received from my stepfather when he passed away. It is not a real old vest but you can see the design elements that go in there. This is a pair of leggings that I made. Actually this is appliqué work but at some point, hopefully in the not too far distant future I am going to replace these with beaded strips and then bead the bottoms of them. This is a pair of leggings that my wife wore when we were married. They were put together by my younger sister and D'Lisa. Nez Perce work is often times floral in nature or geometric in nature and there is a real distinct difference between the two. This is a little bag that my wife D'Lisa made. It kind of characterizes Nez Perce and Plateau work because our people were really fond of the different plants. They often had a little bit of an abstract interpretation of the different plants that were around. This is a piece by Robert Taylor that shows the abstract floral designs that our people are known for."

Individuals such as Chief Joseph were really fond of wearing braid wraps like that. They were just taken from an otter such as this and cut it right down the middle.

But actually the Nez Perce were not on their way to Canada yet, it was a secondary destination. The primary destination was Crow country, over there in present day Billings, Montana, Crow Agency. That is where they were headed to and that is the reason why they came south in the first place. They came down through the Bitterroot Valley and they though they left the war. They thought it was all over. They thought it was complete. They knew General Howard was way behind them somewhere so they took their time going through the Bitterroot Valley. In fact they traded with the settlers. They traded for food, gun powder, blankets and everything else. They thought the war was over.

They got here and then they camped in this place here. You are talking about maybe 750 people, camped out in this valley. You are also looking at probably about 3,000 head of horses that were up all around the hillside, not only up there but also down below here. You had a regular village, a town that was located in this beautiful location. There were 750 people, men, women, children, elders, grandparents, grandchildren, babies. In fact two days before they got here a baby was born. They had a teepee that was way over on the other side that was called the maternity teepee. That is where the baby was kept along with the mother and also the maid. That is where it was. The little baby represented so much. It represented freedom and all these things to the people because they knew that they were looking for another adventure. And so when they came to this location they thought the war was over."

My mom and my dad used to bring me here along time ago when I was just a kid. We used to come back over here. They would come over here and hear stories. I remember Josiah Red Wolf used to be with them, as well as Mazie Ramsey and all them that used to come here in this area. I used to hear some of the stories then from my mom and my dad. They used to tell me, “my relatives died here.” I had relatives on my mom's side that died here and so I really became intrigued with it.

We need this pride in our young people today. Some of our young Nez Perce today have no idea about some of the sacrifices that our old people have done to be where we are now. These warriors, women, and children, that were here, and died here, suffered here. People like my daughter, they need to hear these stories. I see more young people showing up ever so often. Not all of them are going to learn but a few of them are going to take part and learn as much as they can. Maybe down the road, some of the younger ones there when they get older will say, “I should have listened, I should have listened.” Then maybe somewhere along the way the ones that were listening can teach. Again, process of oral history."

Now Watoolin ' was probably one of the main ones. He was an older man but he was also a Tiweet, a medicine man. They had dreams of blood inside the water. They had dreams and visions of death in this valley. So they started talking to Looking Glass and tried to get Looking Glass to send back some scouts because these things are happening to me. Now that is Indian religion. The weyekin as we say, was hitting them. Their vision was helping them. But yet Looking Glass said, “No, we are safe, in fact we traded with the soyaapos, the white people down in the Bitterroot Valley. We are safe.” So they did not send back no scouts."

They had horse races that was going on right here, you had women were up there on the hillside cutting teepee poles, some ladies digging up camas, and some of the men out hunting and so forth. And so a lot of things with typical village life was going on here. That evening of August 8 was a celebration of sorts because they thought the war was over. They headed to a new adventure. There were probably flutes playing here, boys flirting around with the girls and so forth. They talk about stick games that were being played at night as well and bonfires going up. So it was a good time, a good feeling. they stayed up real late, real late.

During the middle of the night, about maybe 3 o'clock or so in the morning August 9, 1877 Colonel Gibbon arrived with his troops who made a march from Fort Shaw. They came through the Bitterroot Valley and came up this area. Along the way they picked up a number of volunteers from the Bitterroot Valley. They were some of the same settlers that the Nez Perce traded with. They were now scouting against them. And now they were coming down into this area in the middle of the night. In fact the soldiers they say were on the base of the hillside. They were very, very scared. These were scared soldiers because they knew that they were in for a fight. Any soldier would be scared.

When we look at history in retrospect, why didn't the horses up there nicker? Why didn't they make any noise for the Nez Perce to be alerted what was going on? According to soldiers' accounts the horses did nicker and then later on they were just kind of scared and they started moving down.

They started working this way toward the village. Again, moving into the swamp area, it was very swampy in some of the locations. There is a lot of flat area too. They were working this way over.

And again another question we ask, why didn't the dogs bark? But again according to the soldiers the dogs did bark, but again the Nez Perce were out.

But not all of them were out. In fact one of the tents over there to my left way back there somewhere, who knows. Some of the warriors were actually cleaning their weapons, getting their weapons ready and they knew something was wrong. They just kept moving very quietly and very slowly, getting their weapons cleaned up and polished. They knew a battle was going to occur soon."

In the end he was half blind. He woke up and he rode across and they heard him, and his horse moving across, moved across over that way. He was moved right into one of the soldiers' positions, they were scattered all through here now . . . all through this area, all the soldiers that were there. He moved into the volunteer section and they shot at him and killed him.

The soldiers then waded across the water and attacked the village. They were on foot, they were infantry, these were not calvary, and they were infantry. They moved across the river in orders of the day by colonel Gibbon at the time was to shoot low into the tepees, shoot low, three volleys move, three volleys move. The soldiers did very well, that's exactly what they did, and they shot low into the tepees.

Many of the people had no idea what hit them. It is just like Josiah Red Wolf mentioned, it was like rain was falling on the tent, the bullets were hitting that hard. The people were scattered, again, it was like chaos . . . terror . . . took place, they knew they were under attack. They scattered every which way through this location, soldiers came in there again just shooting, just shooting, and shooting."

The newborn baby that was born two days ago they thought it would be safe, and they went inside the tent, they crushed the babies head with the rifle butt and killed the mother. They started setting fire to some of these tipis. Some of them did not catch because the dew was very think on them yet. But some of these tipis did catch. They remember hearing the screams of the children inside being burned to death inside. All these things were taking place. It was terrible.

The Nez Perce were driven on the outside. This side here was completely taken, this whole section was a village area. The other side the soldiers had much more rough a time.

Some of our bravest warriors died during this battle. Again, where inside Nez Perce history. Waaliitits, a great warrior. He was one of the three that were Salmon River raised:Waaliitits, Saapsis 'ilpilp, and Wetyetmes weheyqt.

But Waaliitits he died on the other side over there. In fact there was a terrible thing of how he died. He greeted his soldiers, and he went over there and he jumped inside his rifle pit to face them out toward the soldiers. He had to lay by this log and they were shooting at him. Later on he felt somebody behind him and he turned around and it was his wife. She layed right next to him and he turned around and said, “Run, run, it's dangerous out here, 'ayyi 'c (danger), run.” But she didn't run. She wanted to stay by her husband. And soon a volley came over and hit him right in the neck and just flipped him over. She grabbed the weapon of her husband and killed that soldier that killed her husband. Then a volley killed her. When the Nez Perce recovered the area they found her draped over her husband just like she was trying to protect him. These things took place."

Soon though, one of the few times in Indian warfare, I hate to use that term but that is what they use, the village was taken by the soldiers. The Nez Perce were on the outside, they were out by the hillsides over this way and they were scattered around. Soon you could hear the chiefs yelling, “ You young men that wanted this war, look before you. Our women and children are being killed in front of us now. Do something! You young men that wanted this war, this has never happened to the Nez Perce people before.”

Soon the Nez Perce started getting into the cross fire with the soldiers. Hand to hand combat was taking place over here. The soldiers were getting riddled. It was one of the few times inside this type of warfare that the soldiers had the advantage by surprise but they lost the village. They were driven out of this village and they retreated all the way in that seed area, all the way inside that triangle of trees, over there in that draw. The Nez Perce came across over that way and they surrounded them and in time they just kind of started picking them off. They wanted to kill them all and I think they could have. And later on a howitzer came. The howitzer that came, they shot it twice thinking that the Nez Perce would be afraid of it and instead the Nez Perce attacked it. They killed a couple of the crew and the other crew ran away."

As Yellow Wolf says, “you never wanted to hear that sound again.” The people coming back to the village area, the children dead laying on the ground, babies with heads crushed laying on the ground, their wives killed, their parents killed. And again the cries that came from this place, the sorrow, the sadness.

The soldiers even talked about that sound that came from this beautiful area.

The Nez Perce held them that night August 9. They kept them there the next day and then the Nez Perce retreated and they went down south and headed eventually to Yellowstone. But the Nez Perce buried their dead all out through this location.

It is not over. The general Howard finally arrived. He arrived and had Shoshone Bannock Scouts. These Shoshone Scouts came down below here and opened up our graves of all of our people and scalped and mutilated all of our dead, women and children that they could find. This is what happened inside this beautiful, beautiful location we call 'ickum 'kum 'eelxnim"

Small pox is probably the most prevailing disease that has ever hit the northwest. It had a great effect on many of our people. I am reminded of a story of small pox that occurred clear down on the Umatilla River in this case. A young lady was with her family on the upper part of the Umatilla River not quite into Canada but maybe near Echo and that area. Early morning her baby was cranky, crying, irritated and she knew she needed, that her mother would help her. Her mother was camped at the mouth of the Umatilla River, several miles away. So she put her baby in a baby board and proceeded to walk down the river. Hours later the baby had been cranky and she remembered on the baby's body red spots were being developing at that point and time. She knew nothing at that point and time about red spots. As she walked down the river the baby got even more crankier. Then hours later she took the baby out of the baby board on the banks of the Umatilla River. She was in kneeling position and she unraveled the string from the board. To her horror puss was forming on these red spots. And she had heard the stories of small pox and its development. She suspected heavily that he had small pox. She remembered the medicine of one of the doctors that came by. “We'll save you from the diseases of the white man when they get here,” he said, vaccinating the young child. As she stared at her own son she hugged him hoping that maybe she could get the disease and she could take it from her son so that he might live."

Then at 2 a.m., during the early morning the baby stopped crying. Then it stared at the sun as the sun came over. The mother knew the baby died. All her efforts during the night in loving the bare body of her son against her own bare body in hopes of taking the disease was a futile attempt to keep her son alive. But it was all that she knew at this point and time. All day she sat with her baby and she knew that evening would come. She would have to dig a small graveyard for her son and she started. By early morning before daybreak she continued digging. When it was three to four feet deep she rewrapped her son and her baby board and placed the baby into the grave. She started covering her baby until only the face showed. She was tired and she was weak. As the sun came over the mountains she sang her baby's death song. She sang and she noticed she was getting weaker but maybe she thought ‘I should have brought more lunch stuff, more food to eat.' As she covered the babies face for the last time she would have reserved her son's face. As she covered his face she felt a tug on her right shoulder and she turned to see.

“Mom. Mom.”

“What? What?”

“I had a vision you wanted to see me. So I came looking for you. Mom I just buried my son. He had smallpox. Don't touch me mom. You might get it, too.”

“But you have not seen yourself, have you?”"

“Mom I got it.”

As the two sat there, wanting to hug each other knowing they can't. The closeness of daughter and mother. The mother, helpless wanting to help her daughter. Knowing there is no cure to what her daughter had.

“Mom I am not here for much longer. Will you help me dig my grave yard?” Together they did, on the riverbank and most of it was rock. The daughter did as much as she could. Finally it was about 4 ft. deep and maybe 3 ft. across on the bottom. The daughter laid in there and said,

“Mom, mom, cover me.”

“But.”

“Mom I say this mom. I know I am leaving you but I know that I will be with my son. I will go with my son. Cover me mom.” This were the last words the mother heard, “Cover me mom.”"

As she watches her daughter's spirit leave her body the daughter picks up her infant son's spirit and they are a few feet away from the mother. The spirit turns and waves at the mother.

My name is Tipyeléhne Cimuux Cimux That vaguely translates into Black Eagle. Cimuux cimux is the color black but it comes from the word símux which is charcoal that comes from a fire. Tipyeléhne is an eagle that comes from the stories that our people tell, what is commonly referred to as myths or legends. We simply just call them stories. This character would go around in the different stories and would offer advice or wisdom to help people solve a certain predicament that they were in or overcome a certain challenge that they were encountering. Children often times were named in a ceremony where they would have to, I remember the ceremony I was in when I received my name Tipyeléhne Cimuux Cimux. My grandmother was facilitating it and she put out a large blanket on the floor during a powwow. I was just a little boy and she started to pile blankets over me. I was standing there and it was the middle of August. It was right during the powwow at Kamiah and they had it in the weey 'ees gymnasium. I remember that it was so hot to be standing there in the regalia that was worn by the Black Eagle that came before me. I was standing there and it was wool leggings and a wool shirt and then there were blankets, shawls and different things that were put over me. I was sitting there just sweating like crazy. I remember constantly having to wipe the sweat from my forehead. Each time a person would come up they would whisper that name in my ear and then they would take something off from me. So by hearing my name my burden became lighter. It was a symbolism that said this name is going to carry you through the tough times in your life or else it is going to guide you to help you make your life easier, make you family's life easier, and make your people's life easier because often a times a person would follow that name and learn things about the world that would come back to the people and help them to survive. For example, if somebody had a fish name they were really good at fishing and they knew how to easily go to the streams and harvest fish and bring it back to the people to use. That often times went for names that had to do with game animals like elk and the animals from the air like birds. There are all kinds of different names for our people that we use. This is one necklace that my grandmother gave me when I received my name. I wore this during the ceremony."

No matter who your elder is, if they are older than you, one year, two years they have rank on you and you have to listen to them. That is the way my grandmothers all taught us. Another thing is the confusion over cousins. That was one thing my grandma always told us, there are no cousins, you are brothers and sisters and you treat each other as such. To this day our cousins don't call each other cousins, we call each other brother and sister. On my dad's side, all of my aunts and uncles have raised us to be like that, too. It is a shame to call your cousin a cousin. So we are pretty close in my family for that reason. My grandmother taught us to be like that, always to jump in and help each other. If you see your family struggling, then you are supposed to jump in and help them. Don't hold back. You witness this and it makes you stronger as a family to pull together in rough times and in easy times it makes the going get easier when you are all pitching in together and working towards a goal. I see it in our family. A lot of people come back and ask our family, “How do you do this?” or “How come you guys are still doing it?” We tell them we had a good grandmother on both sides and we had aunts that were really strict with us and teaching us, not to let us forget about how to do things.

You always had a male figure showing you the way to do things. I can remember going down the river at, he was overseas and I lost the wheel on my rig. It just flew down the river. My uncle Ty was there before the police even got there. He helped me find my tire and he put it back on and he says, “ I'll always be there for you.” These are the kind of uncles I've had, real strong uncles. My grandfather, I can remember him doing the feather work not just the beadwork. He did learn how to do beadwork in later years but I can always see him doing the old style feather work. He was always busy with his hands and he was a carpenter. They did a lot of work and encouragement from horseback riding. I had a lot of uncle that were riders and encouraging us to do it a certain way. Sometimes they'd be strict with you but that strictness is what made you try harder. That is what I remember about my uncles, too. So it is not just the female figures, the male figures had a lot to say in how we were raised, too."

That was my maternal grandmother. She was a handicapped woman. In her early days of travel she had an accent driving along the road with a team of horses. And I don't know what happened, either the tongue broke or the wagon wheel come off. But anyways she rolled down the side of the road and she hurt her back and she was humpbacked like that (finger curves to show the image of her back), she could not straighten her back from the waste up. It was humped over. She was a very strong woman. I seen her do things when I was just a little guy. She could chop wood, carry wood, she could saw wood with a saw, she could put up a teepee herself, put the poles up. I learned a lot of that kind of work from her. So many things that, she had little tricks for everything, how to make things easier. And then of course the language was one of the main parts, learning to speak the language. Sometimes I would say a word that wasn't quite right. Now instead of telling me I made a mistake or I was wrong she'd just simply repeat the word and tell me how it was supposed to be. And that is the way I thought my language was. Never tell anybody they are wrong. It makes a person feel a little bit different when you tell somebody they are wrong. And that is one thing I learned is that you can disturb a person's mind very quickly by some of the things you say even though you know that they are wrong but then you correct them in a good way. I've tried to do that all my life. But everything she did mostly was living as a family, unity in a family. We'd come down and listen to her sing and I would start learning how to sing them songs with her. Then there was a blessing of the food all the time, every meal. Not just once a day, every meal. Also there was bedtime blessing. That was another thing to look forward to. It seemed like you could sleep better, just a reaction but then it worked. Then her abilities were so important to me also because you could go out and pick all these different kinds of roots, knew how to prepare them and knew how to cure everything."

One of the ones I understand was, really a fun thing was, they carved out tops, little tops, with pieces of wood or bark and then they would have a contest to see who's top would stay spinning the longest, on ice. That was one of the things then. But of course there were all kinds of little toys. We used to make little boats out of bark and we'd used to wittle a little boat out of back; we'd go up the creek, put it in the water and run down along there to watch it come down the stream. Sometimes we'd put a sail on it. That was our entertainment."

And many of our family just like a lot of the families really turned towards Christianity and what not. So that hampered some of the passing of traditions on in our family. But just like in all families there were people who did carry these things on. These two ladies were the ones that really influenced me because I remember they lived up until modern times. Katherine lived up until 1981 and Annie lived up until close to the early 90's. I can't remember. They were born in the 1800's so they were around 100 years old when they died.

They were one of the last ones on this reservation who didn't speak English and didn't write English at all. They were the last ones here and they were the last ones who dressed in the traditional way of the Plateau women everyday. Not only like us where we dress up for Powwows or other festive occasions, they dressed like that every day with wing dresses that they made.

I always think about them and the way they are always preparing for things. I remember hearing my grandmother talk about them and the kind of force that they had. They used to get up and do their work. Then after they would do their work in the morning they would sit down and make a dozen wing dresses in one day. Finally she asked them, “Why are you making so many wing dresses? Why do you need a whole stock?” She would do that almost everyday. She told them in Nez Perce the reason she was doing that was because she was preparing herself for one day when she would not be able to make them for herself because she knew that time was coming. Sure enough both of them were bed ridden and went blind and rather than put the burden on somebody else to try to clothe them or whatever they made them for that time when they were going to be bed ridden.

I think about those kinds of things too and it is important in the way I try to somehow conduct myself in terms of the creation of these things, it is kind of hard to call them art, that we use. The things I make I make them not to hang on the wall necessarily or for mere decoration but I make them to be used. When they are used, when I put on an outfit it makes me kind of feel like I come alive with all these things. That is what they are helping me do, come alive when I dance and then they all move, everything moves. That is what they are intended for, for me."

Now we employ during the field season, during the spring or summer, we employ over 200 people and our annual budget is several million.

Nez Perce people were a major fishing tribe. They utilized the Colombia and the Snake River tributaries to where we used to historically have millions of fish that would come into the upper Snake and Clearwater. We are talking between 5 to 8 million fish just up here in the Lewiston area: steelhead, spring, fall, and summer chinook, coho, sockeye. They have now dwindled to where we may get, in some cases, over one hundred thousand chinook to a couple hundred thousand, and in the case of the sockeye salmon we may get one or two fish a year."

The third is located on Big Canyon Creek which is on the Clearwater River at Peck just below Orofino. At these sights we bring in fall chinook salmon smolts and sub-yearlings and we will acclimate them for a month pumping water from the river into circular tanks.

They fly the gametes, which are on ice, to Moscow, to UI and WSU. These gametes are stored with liquid nitrogen so we actually have our own sperm bank containing native salmon genetics. We actually have those stored for future purposes if the declining salmon runs get really bad we have these to fall back on.

It is a brand new state of the art hatchery and we've been waiting for over 10 years for this to come about and finally it should be done this spring. There we will have earth ponds for smolt rearing and we will have what they call, “natures design raceways.” For people who have been at regular hatcheries they are pretty much accustomed to those flat, straight rectangular raceways.

This is one of our natures design rearing channels. This will be for rearing spring chinook salmon, fingerlings. We have got the design that is trying to mimic the contour of a stream. We have artificial substrate, set into place. Also along the sides, once the construction is complete, we will have an artificial riparian zone with vegetation, trees and brush, and growing along the sides. We will try to provide a natural cover for the fish while they are living in this stream channel. From here we will take the fish to some our satellite facilities up Lolo Creek and Yusa Creek where we will be working with spring chinook salmon and acclimate them up there to those streams and release them.

So for the majority of their lives or their young lives, when they are fingerlings, they will be held here (at the hatchery). In the future we may introduce natural predators and do a natural conditioning such as the northern pike minnow and also live feed. The plan is also to install some bug zappers. So instead of zapping the bugs and cooking them, we will have an attracting light and little wheeled powels that will spin around and actually bat the bugs into the water. That is just one of the ideas. We have a lot of things to look forward to."

Decomposing salmon carcasses are a natural part of the ecosystem here in Idaho and the decline of salmon runs we've seen over the last 30, 40, 50 years. Those elements that the salmon bring back from the ocean have been lost. In years past other hatcheries have been land filling excess carcasses, taking them to the dump and burying them.

But the Nez Perce tribe feels that these carcasses need to be placed back into the environment where they came from. Other than adding nutrients for fish, it adds food for eagles, otters, and other species of animals that live along the streams and also those that live in the stream such as macro invertebrates, such as crayfish, insect larvae and other little younger species of fish that will feed on them. They are all part of a web, a food chain. The loss of these nutrients that are picked up from these animals that feed on them, distribute them through the environment whether they are in the riparian zones or up in the mountain side, the natural fertilization that occurs has been lost. The use of these carcasses for this purpose is a wise one."

That is what we call it, our new breeding project. We are crossing appaloosa mares with stallions of the Akhal-Teke breed. The Akhal-Teke horse is native to Turkmenistan and it is one of the rarest breeds of horses in the world. In Spain around 1491, early 1490's Spain finally drove out the moors, the North Africans that had conquered their country for over 500 years. These people had hot-blooded horses, desert horses including the barb horses of North Africa, Arabian horses and strains of Turkmen horses. These were desert breed horses that were light bodied and thin skinned and had the ability to run long distances and were very fast. These horses were breed with native Spanish horses and these horses with the mixed blood were brought to Americas by the Spanish conquistadors right after Christopher Columbus stumbled upon the Americas. We knew that these horses were a large part, they played a large part in the horses that our ancestors wrote. As colonists from the Atlantic coast came further west they brought other strains of horses that were more powerful, built more for carrying weight. So these slimmer horses were slowly breed out. What we wanted to do is to recreate or reestablish a type of horse that our immediate Nez Perce ancestors were well known for in the 17 and 1800's. The tribe thought that the best way to do that would be to locate a strain of horse that was one of the ancestors of these horses. In 1979 forty rare Akhal-Teke horses who are the purest strain of what is known as a Turkmen horse were imported to America. They were slim and lanky and they are known to be able to run 120 miles a day 10 days in a row."

We have one that is early 1900's that I wear that belonged to my great-grandmother Cecilia Shawaway and that is who I named after, Talaltlilpt. Talaltlilpt means sunset. Usually that is what I wear and I also wear a cornhusk hat. Then the horse will be dressed in the horse trappings and horse collar. Usually they are beaded and sometimes it is cornhusk. We put different cornhusk bags or other old beaded bags on the horses. Sometimes we have a traditional horse saddle, which is the high horn on the front and the same on the back. It is a little different from the saddles that we ride around in. You kind of feel secure and safe in there, like you wouldn't be able to fall out. When you are parading you are trying to represent your culture as the most authentic regalia pieces that you can gather up and a lot of it is family heirlooms and things that have been passed down. It is a really nice feeling to get into those old outfits."

They would travel over Lolo Pass, even go by way of Yellowstone and then up in order to acquire buffalo. The horse made it easier to get over there and the rifle made it easier to bring down animals quicker. That was something that changed the speed at which Indians were able to acquire food but it didn't rightly change the amount, for example there were still rules that told people exactly how much buffalo they were supposed to bring down. One might think that maybe the rifle lended to people utilizing more buffalo but I don't think that was the case because there were definitely traditions and rules about hunters bringing down more than they could use. They weren't supposed to do that. That was always remembered. Definitely the distance changed at which you could retrieve an animal. A rifle has a pretty high velocity and that keeps the bullet pretty steady as opposed to an arrow. So the distance at which you could bring down an animal changed greatly."

She passed away and this is one of the grandmothers that paraded all the time was my grandmother and they called each other sister. I believe she made it, I haven't found out for sure.

One example of horse regalia that I brought is what we call a ----temúuheyqt means something that you drape over something else. This was placed over the head of the horse and it is a real fine example of the geometric designs that the Nez Perce were well known for. This piece was actually put together and beaded by Nakia Williamson and Cheryl Stienhauer It's a real nice example of the work that our people do. On some of the martingales you'll notice that there are designs that look like scratches. There is a story about a man amongst the Cayuse people that fought with a grizzly bear. He received near fatal wounds and he was very sick, he was near death. He received a vision about a grizzly bear that came to him and said because of what you have done, because of your bravery and taking my life I give you these scars to take with you. That bear scratched him across his chest like that. It made wound that were really small and they widened out and then they tapered again right across his chest and those are the scars that he wore for the rest of his life. The ladies of the time they got together and they made a sash for him and that was something that he wore so the people would know that was something that he was recognized for. That was a deed he had done in his lifetime. Naturally when the horses came they would take those sashes and they would place them over the head of the horse and then they would ride in ceremonies and honor the old people for what they did, the sacrifices that they had made so that the people would survive. You can see the symbolism in our regalia that talk about those stories. Every piece that is based upon the old designs you can see the different renditions of that story and how it is portrayed by each family from the Nez Perce. There are family designs and there are designs that are common amongst the entire tribe and even designs that are common amongst the other nations on the plateau."

This was before there were human beings. The life that was on the earth then was all animals, different kinds of nature animals, birds and stuff. He called these things Waqiswíitme. Letíitelwit is human beings. This is before human beings. This is the story about how he created human beings and different tribes. He used to roam around the land and he used to swallow all these living things, living people they called them then. They all lived inside of this monsters belly, stomach. One day coyote was close by and he heard them hollering from inside, ""Can somebody come and help us? We want to get out of here."" He went and he heard them and their concern. Their concern was can somebody kill this monster so we can get out. Coyote went and gathered up all the other people, the other animals that were still not swallowed. He got them and they had a council. He wanted to find out, get some ideas on how to do this. They decided they would try to find some way lure this monster over so they could kill him. That is where coyote started this project of his own. He went and started digging. He dug what they call súula a big canyon. He started digging. It was long and deep. He got to thinking I wonder if I can get this monster to come down through here. So then he decided to dig a little more so he kept digging. All the dirt and rocks that he threw out into different piles as he went along, he threw all these out in different piles and this became the Seven Devils, the Seven Devil Mountains. This canal or whatever they called it then, súula was long and deep and that became Hells Canyon. After he got this all done he decided, he started thinking again I got to have some kind of weapon. He decided to make a long bowstring they call it tiwíiwas. He made this out of all the growth along the rivers and all the creeks, like willows. He made a strong cord out of it and he strung it across both sides and tied it onto big rocks and he stretched it tight. So then about that time he heard the monster coming down the canyon. He got all ready and put an arrow in his bow, he stretched it back and shot the monster and killed him."

He gave them different names according to the sounds they made and the way they looked. When he gave the rattlesnake a name, they called him wéexpus. The rattlesnake got mad so coyote stepped on his head like that. That is why the rattlesnake has a flat head. After he had done that he made another plan. This time he thought well I got this body of the monster so I am going to make human beings, different tribes. So he cut the monster's body into different pieces and starts throwing them in different directions. That is when he decided to throw a piece of meat that way and he said, ""That way is going to be the Shoshones. Then he threw another chunk this other way, ""That is going to be the ShoBan people."" All different tribes he threw like that, different ways. The Crows, the Sioux, the Yakima, quite a few different listed there, over in Umatilla, people up in Usk. They call them qem'eespelu. He made all these different tribes from the monster's body. After that these people that came to life became people. They came over here and they told the monster with tears in their eyes, ""Thank you for making us people from the monster's body but we have one concern. You didn't make any people from right here where you killed the monster."" That is when the coyote made his last decision. The only thing that was left there was the monster's heart. So he walked over and picked up the heart and squeezed it like that and then drained it and blood run out on the ground. That is when he said, ""Here there is going to be the Nez Perce people, the Nimiipuu they call them. They are going to be beautiful people, they are going to be proud people, and they are going to have a kind and loving heart. They'll take care of this land."" So he got finished and then he said, ""I made all these people and all these living things, these animals out of this monsters body because this is where the monster used to roam all over this land."" This is the story about the heart of the monster."

Then you have the stories of creation. How the animals change from big animal people to small animal people, and how Coyote was created, and he was given all these powers, and then he created the human beings. He scattered all the remains of the monster that he slew in all the directions. And they became the Indians of the western hemisphere. And then Coyote traveled the world and this is where all the Coyote stories come from and start from. Some of those stories are preserved. And then once the human beings came here there was explanations of why human beings did certain things, or why the unknown was trying to be told in a logical way. This is what some of stories tell."

He was in a hurry putting up his tipi so the story goes that while he was inside working on his regalia a wind storm came and took his tipi down. It collapsed on him.

Another story goes that Coyote got caught, he got tied up like that and they tied his head and legs together but he could still get loose. Then they tied him up a different way, they thought well we'll tie him a little tighter this way. Then they really cinched it down so it was real tight but he still was able to get loose. Yeah they used to tell a lot of stories.

Then they told about the Coyote meeting the Fox up on the hill. It is supposed to be something like that. Coyote and the Fox were talking away in a distance and then they parted company. Do you remember that one?"

When we were out there dancing of course we were not out there dancing for thousands and hundreds of dollars like we do today. We were dancing out there not only to look good but to show what we could do, our moves and what we learned from our uncles and grandfathers. If there was a kind of a contest it was fun but we knew we weren't expecting much. Maybe a blanket or if there was some cash that would be fine but nothing real specific. It was more for honor it seems like in those days compared to today.

One of the elders told me when he is dancing he is not only mimicking an animal or a bird. One of the elders said when you are dancing you be sure and look over your shoulder, look back and see if your shadow is following you. If your shadow is there, well that is a good sign. Titooqatimtki mine wees saqis. You look around while you are dancing, you make these certain moves. So many of the moves that are made traditionally during dancing are not an accident. Some of the moves you see traditional dancers doing out there are looking up to the sky or looking around. Maybe he is a hunter or a scouter or something making these motions. A lot of things go on during these ceremonies that aren't explained, maybe some of the viewers don't even understand. I like to try to, one of the boxers used to say float like a butterfly. I like to move like a dragonfly. When I can move and make people feel good well then I know I am healing someone and it makes me feel good, too."

It is really important because it was a song that was used during a signing of a very important thing that had to take place between the different tribes. As you can see all these warriors and people riding horses and singing a song as they are riding into the campground before they have this big event. It is like a grand opening but yet you knew it was a song that was sung just for that purpose, for that special event. Maybe they were returning their warriors from battle or whatever, but it had to be a special event. Whereas if you were carrying the flute or singing a love song to someone that is certainly a different story altogether. The national anthem when it is sung it really means something, rather than just a song that they picked out of page 22."

They have their own stories; they are just trying to create their own glory or something. I kind of appreciate and respect them for trying to get a little bit of glory and all that but if it is wrong, it is not right. I should write that down, that sounded all right there. I know this is all true because my great grandfather was in that battle and those other guys I know, I don't think they can vouch for that. During one of our battles when the guns, cavalry were shooting those cannons at the guys, the guys would holler and wave at them and those cannons would go off and they would duck down or dive for cover or take off and go somewhere else and pop up again and holler and wave at them and make them turn the cannon and shoot that way, duck down again and dive and go the other way. They were making them waste their ammo, making those guys lose their balls. That is one way of saying that they wanted to win the war.

The other thing that is really important and significant in that battle is when my great grandfather was involved with, I don't know how many other guys it took but they helped steal or overtake the guys and push one of these cannons over the hill, down the mountainside. That makes me pretty proud. So when we have that duck and dive contest or that song it is not only that I really like it, but it seems like it is pretty popular not only our people, but it is getting popular among other tribes, too.

As much as I like it and as much as I respect it there is one question mark that I have about the use of a song, that is in a sense sacred, for contests. I really enjoy dancing to it and I know everybody else does and the crowds they all stand because they really enjoy. They feel the power of that song when we are out there dancing. In that respect I guess it is good but it my own mind I just wonder if it almost like sacrilegious using a sacred song for contests that involves competition and money and things like that. That is my own personal question mark I have. Anyways, back to the basics of that song. That is why it is so important because it represented that battle."

They brought her around to different celebrations. And she was always exposed to dance and she was, I guess you can say, a prize dancer in her time with her traditional dancing where she would place here and there. And so it started out for us at a young age. She would bring us around to different Powwows and any opportunity we had in Lapwai she would dress us up. And of course the extended family is important because they help with gathering your regalia. I have a dress from my grandmother Katherine Louise Heigal that she had made me and aunties making me different outfits. One of the first dances I did as a little kid is I wanted to dance like a boy. That was the fancy dance because I liked the big bells and how they sounded. And so my dad I remember him getting me bells. I wanted to be just as loud as the men out there and so I learned how to fancy dance like a boy. I remember even trying to teach some of my male cousins how to dance like a boy. One time I even owl danced with my own sister. And so that was kind of fun and we look back and laugh at that. So those were my first experiences as, from dancing and I am glad that our mother exposed us to that because we were shown the way and then growing up you could either leave it, take it or leave it. Some have stepped away but once you have been exposed to that you can step back and participate again. And uhm so I am really glad she exposed us to that because that prepared for me for the opportunities that have been really exciting for me to dance with the Mishantucket-Pequot dance troop. In which I've toured with them to several different countries and all over the United States. Ya know just gettin' to know a lot of people, and the ambassador not only of my tribe but of the whole Indian nation."

You try to think and pray for the individual , like praying for your enemies, and you are primarily praying for yourself, asking the creator to give you strength so you won't have these bad feelings. So anything you have you throw them in the red-hot rocks, if you didn't do it by the fire prior to going into the Sweat. When you come out of the sweat you are supposed to come out “clean.” You are supposed to feel good and be able to sleep like a baby because you not only feel good physically but also mentally, maybe even drained because of all the participation inside, activities like singing and what have you, and all the heat. That is one thing I wanted to share that is really important."

That was used when an individual really needed, extra strength. He needed that real, I guess it would be like, super powers. You know you are talking about closer to Mother Earth. You get right in there with the mud and you are really part of her. It not only makes you feel good but it soaks right in, all the minerals. The Indian people a long time ago didn't talk about all the chemistry, the iron, the zinc and all the different chemicals in the dirt, the mud. Later on you learn about these things. Anyways, if an individual was going out to hunt you knew he really wanted to be successful and that is what he'd do. He'd go to Teméeyenwees (mud baths). And he'd be so darn clean, so strong and no animal could smell you because you smelled like Mother Earth. You were clean. Then I know of many elders that go mud bath before they'd go to stick games so they would really be clean, almost like invisible and they'd be able to win. Even card players or Powwow people, dancers, contestants, rodeo riders, or maybe a foot racer. It seemed like anyone that wanted to have that real special boost in power. It is not as fast as a sweat. A sweat bath takes maybe an hour or so. You cut up the wood and put the rocks on the wood, you heat it up and you put it in the sweathouse and throw the water on.

The Teméeyenwees (mud baths) you have to have a special place. You have to choose, well even for a sweathouse you usually choose a special place but you have to have the right kind of dirt. It is almost like clay and you have to know how to mix it to consistency, how much water to put in there, how deep you want it so that you can be able to get out, and how many rocks to put in there so you get the mud bubbling. It is almost like imagining yourself sitting in Yellowstone, not that hot but hot enough to cook you in a good way. Not like a lobster or anything like that. It takes a long time. It takes a whole day to do it right and the preparations. It depends on who you are with or who is doing it. They probably have their special songs for that. Some tribes they probably have to have gifts for Mother Earth or the Creator. If you want to bring some friends or relatives, your wife or whoever it may be there are so many exercise or rules that you follow before it is done right. Otherwise it would be just life as they say, just any old way. When you do something that sacred you know it has to be done right otherwise something might go wrong. If you know you are missing something it is like sitting in a racing car with only three wheels. You know something is wrong and that is not right.

Sol Webb was a tribal fishing chief, a sub chief, right up here and they worked out of Celilo Falls, which is below here a few miles and that is where he was chief that delegated authority and who would fish in which spot and made sure rotations were made. People were allocated what they were needed and long houses were kept up to date. He showed everybody else. My dad's side, they fish but not a lot. I had never heard about it before. But my mom's side, my great grandfather, Sol Webb, would just tell us that we have been doing this for a long time. It is something that I was never shown that was important. You know people don't know that, Nez Perce have traded down here. The Dalles is one of the major hubs, below Celilo Falls, it was one of the major hubs of trade. People would come from all these different regions, what used to be the Washington territory, Montana, Idaho, Oregon, all these areas. They used to come into this area to trade for the fish, the dried fish. It is really important. Something you can preserve for a long time, people practice these traditions of preserving these fish. It is really good protein. It is a good way to replenish yourself during the hard times, during the winter when it would be a long time before you could go hunt or anything. It was commerce. Even when the white people first started coming into this area, they weren't fisherman. They come in here and think that, I mean I am not putting them down. They came in here after we were here and we let them know that you could catch fish and people never looked at salmon fisheries as being important. Then you can over utilize the resources. We used to trade. My friends and relatives tell me we used to go all the way to the Plains people would come and trade for the fish. We learned a lot of their traditions and values, exchanged a lot of ideas with them, like getting the teepee and they got a resource from us knowing that fish could be used for sustenance. It was really important for them that they could come that far to trade for it. It is more important than you think when that was the economy, based on this type of thing, trade, barter. That was the money then. It was important."

This is salmon that has been canned. It stores easily. You can also do elk meat in the same way. This is hóopop. This is a tree lichen that was gathered from the trees and it was baked with camas in the ground for three days. Then it is dried and you can rehydrate this and make a little bit of a mush with it.

This is some camas that my wife did. These are prepared together, the hóopop and the camas.

Then there are also smoked versions of salmon. There are a number of different ways that our people prepared these different foods.

They were always something that you were constantly preparing and your anticipation of surviving their winter or having enough food around for your children to eat. It is a lot of forethought to be able to go out and know how much fish that you are supposed to have for the winter to feed five people or ten people or an entire village. There were always people to oversee that. That was something that had to be carefully governed so that there was enough food for the people that are alive today and enough was let go so that it would go back to where it was from and reproduce to come back and feed the people next year and the next year after that and so on and so forth all the way into the future. It was that careful thought process that allowed us to live in harmony with the land as people say, coexistence."

Even something as simple as an arrow took quite some time and it was quite a mastery to be able to do that because each one had to be made just so, so the arrow would find its mark. Here you can see the differences in the way the arrows were made. This arrow has a stone point on it. Later, wagon wheels and different pieces of iron were used to make the heads. They were sharpened with rocks and different things. The amount of work that just goes into putting an arrowhead onto an arrow shaft is amazing because you have to know how to flint knap and there is a good amount of expertise that goes into that. Plus each time that you shot this arrow it was likely to break because this is a form of glass and the velocity of the arrow would often times break or even shatter the arrowhead. So when this came along it was something you could use time and time again. That is one interesting change that has gone on as well."

Often times there was a long buckskin string put on here so that somebody from horseback could lower their drinking cup to the stream without having to get off the horse. They could turn it like that and pull themselves up a nice cool drink from the stream. Yeah, this is a buffalo horn and horns were something that were very important for making tools and different implements that you needed not only to acquire food, but utilize those foods.

Right now Nakia Williamson and myself are involved in trying to make a bow out of mountain sheep horns. That was a real mastery because somebody in our ancestry figured out how to take a mountain sheep horn and end up with a bow. The amount of work that goes into there is just amazing because you take the mountain sheep horn and you cut off that back part and you would join them together in the middle. This is just a standard wood bow but this is about the size that they would end up with. These bows were highly sought after by many people across the Plateau and even out onto the plains because of its ability to give the arrow a high velocity with a small bow. Some of them were well over a hundred pounds in pressure. It was something that was small enough for a rider to use on horseback and be able to go back and forth and shoot buffalo and take them down with one arrow being able to pass all the way through the body of that buffalo. That was something that was really important to the Nez Perce and that was something that we always utilized in buffalo country and war as well."

They'd tie them on there like that and carry them wherever they'd eat. They say a long time ago they used to use baskets to cook in. They'd heat the rocks and put the rocks in with their meat and water and make soup."

This is a real old style of tule mat that was wound around in a coiled fashion I guess.

If you get a little bit of a close up of what it looks like you an see that it is wrapped around each other. You might be able to see the line that goes right through here but that is how it was held together.

These mats were used ceremonially and also for shelter and even for making bags to carry things in. They were used for storage. One of the neat things about this plant is that when it gets wet it swells a little bit. When it swells it shuts out the ability for water to pass through it and it would just feed the water off to the side. It would take a lot of these different mats to make one shelter for one family. It was something that was constantly kept up on to keep the lodge in good order. You'll notice on the edge here there's a little bit of what we call qému that was used in making string. That was a plant that we have that we harvest in the fall time and you just take the bark and you twist it together and it makes a real good string, a real good rope."

If you were there deliberating the course of action that you should take for your family, for your tribe. The white man had a very terrible reputation of killing mostly women and children. The old statement they made, knits make lice, mothers make children. So they always attempted to kill the women and the girls off so they wouldn't have any more Indian kids. As you sit there wondering, do I sign a treaty or do I not? If I don't sign a treaty, will they kill my children off? I wonder what would happen if our brother the deer could sit right there and listen to the discussion of treaties, or the bear, or the elk, the hawks, the eagle. As we sign this land away, we are not only giving up our rights on it but their rights also, our animal brothers and sisters. Always they have supported our way of living; always these animals were there when we needed them. And now we give the land up to the white man. What will the white man do with all you animals? At this point we can only guess. We signed the treaty. After we signed the treaty, with much remorse we returned to our camps. Our older women, our young women and the girls they cut their hair short after they had witnessed the signing of the treaties. The older women cut off their thumbs and they let the blood drain on Mother Earth in sorrow. They cry heavily for what they have done and what they have just witnessed. They allow their blood from their thumb to drip in a circle to nourish the Mother Earth. The tears that flowed from their eyes, it saturated the dust. Mother Earth was sad and so are we. They had three fires where as they cut off their hair they burned it. They burned the hair in each one of these three fires. As they watched their men return after they had signed the treaty, they too took their turn. They built their own fires and they cut their own braids. They took their drum and they sang their mournful death song. Quiet at first, hoping Mother Earth would listen to the drumbeat, each chief asking, what have we done with our lands? What will we do for our children?

We have already given up millions of acres. Our land used to run to the Yellowstone National Park, up to Livingston, straight west to the Columbia River, straight south to maybe Burns, straight east back to Yellowstone Park. Comprising of approximately 28 million acres. Out of that 28 million acres we carved 13.5 million acres in the '55 treaty area. The government forgot about the 15 million acres. They have never attempted to compensate us for its losses. Instead they just took the land and called it their own. We would hope with the land free of any encompasses of the other 15 million acres that they would allow us to live on the '55 treaty area without molestation, without trespassing. That was not to be, but instead they reduced us again with the '63 treaty. That '63 treaty was fraudulently made. Our elders today can only sense a very few names of the 51 signatures that are on the '63 treaty, which means then that the interpreter that came out here for the '63 treaty had maybe a dozen signatures of the Indians and he made up the rest and placed an ‘x' on the paper. Congress wouldn't know whether it was fraudulent or not; all they wanted was signatures. But the Indians at that time and even today, we actually have no recourse. Who can we complain to?

The principles are that there are two parties who are sitting down to negotiate an agreement. In this case in the case of treaties, it was two sovereign nations, the Nez Perce Tribe and the United States. In the course of those negotiations the principle thing to look at is what were the intentions of the parties, what did the parties reach agreement upon. In the Nez Perce Tribe's 1855 treaty, one of the important components is that the Tribe reserved to itself a homeland, millions of acres in the initial treaty and as I stated that has been dwindled down to the current reservation of about 750,000 acres.

The other component is what sort of other rights did they reserve outside of that homeland. They reserved hunting and fishing and gathering and grazing rights within that treaty. Other components of the treaty were, because the Tribe gave up land, there was compensation. So the Tribe received money and promises of other types of services from the United States for giving up that land that was once their exclusive territory. Another thing that is important as a lawyer to consider in looking at these treaties is the tribes were at a disadvantage during these negotiation. They didn't speak quite often the English language. When Governor Stevens and the other treaty negotiators in 1855 met with them, what Stevens said was often translated sometimes through a couple of translators into the Nez Perce language. The courts have said that what is controlling is what the tribes interpreted the treaty to understand. One good example of this is in the Shoshone Bannock Treaty. They reserved the right to hunt and the Idaho Supreme Court said that in the Shoshone language the word hunt also means fish so their hunting right has been interpreted to also include a fishing right.

So it is important when you are reading these treaties to consider what was the intention of the parties, more importantly what was the intention of the tribe when they agreed to what was contained in that treaty. I mentioned the hunting and fishing right. It is important to consider that the Nez Perce Tribe was a fishing culture. They depended upon salmon and steelhead and other fish for a number of purposes: religion, culture, trading with other tribes. They also depended on other resources on the land. The right to go to buffalo country to hunt buffalo, the right to hunt elk, the right to gather camas and other roots and berries, huckleberries as well as the right to gather firewood and of course to graze their horses because another important component of Nez Perce culture was the appaloosa horse. These are all things when you look at the Treaty of 1855 that you want to consider, what are the intentions of the parties and how would the Nez Perce Tribe have understood it."

It wasn't as large as the area the Tribe initially occupied but it was an enormous Reservation. Due to pressures from settlers to enter that Reservation and settle as well as to mine gold, in the 1860's there was a subsequent treaty that resulted in the current Reservation of about 750,000 acres of land. That treaty did not take away any of these off-reservation hunting, fishing, grazing, and gathering rights (“usual and accustomed areas”) but eroded the land base of the Nez Perce Tribe.

In the 1890's there was an agreement between the Nez Perce Tribe and the United States (Dawes Act). Each tribal family agreed to take 160 acres of land and the rest of the Reservation was open to settlement by non-Indians. That has resulted in an enormous erosion of the Tribe's land base. Currently, of that 750,000 acres the Tribe owns about 20% of that land. Again, that agreement despite taking away more of the land did not take away any of the Tribe's hunting, fishing, grazing and gathering rights.

The United States has consistently recognized that those rights are key to Nez Perce culture, Nez Perce religion, and really the sovereignty of the Tribe. Those are key components of what make the Nez Perce people the Nez Perce people.

Other court cases have continued to erode Tribal sovereignty. The Supreme Court has stated that tribes don't have any criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians. Recent Supreme Court cases even question the jurisdiction of the tribe to regulate its land, specifically when these lands are held by non-Indians. The tribe does its best given the current legal climate to assert its sovereignty and protect its land and people. The facts are right now that the Supreme Court and other courts of this nation have not looked favorably upon assertions of tribal sovereignty."

The amount of knowledge that is contained in that food round, that food cycle is enormous because the people and their experience of being from this areas and originating in this area always had to go out and look for food. Yet, they did not want to leave their homelands and be nomadic.

That is something that is a misconception about the Nez Perce is that they are often referred to as a nomadic people. Nomads follow the food no matter where it goes but the Nez Perce are transhumance which means they go in a cycle and end up back to where they originated.

In the springtime the food cycle would begin in the river bottoms and the lower valleys where there wasn't much snow as in say the mountaintops. They would winter there because it was warmer; there was less food that was necessary to survive because the colder the elements are the more food you need to survive in that area. They would winter in the lower river bottoms and then in the springtime they would start by gathering the root foods and different foods in the lower river valleys along with the salmon, the spring runs of salmon.

Then it would progress slowly to higher elevations and eventually in the fall time they would end up near the headwaters of the streams and harvesting deer and elk from the forest. There are areas up in higher countries where camas was available. Then they would start harvesting those foods and then as it grew colder again they would slowly progress back down to the river bottoms. It was always according to what plant was available or what food was available in the forest. The old people were definitely not nomadic; they were transhumance. They followed a definite and distinct pattern of acquiring those foods."

Those times when my mom was preparing these different foods or seeing my grandmother prepare different foods. That is something that I really enjoy. Not just thinking about but carrying on and thinking about the ways I'm going to teach my children to do the same thing. It is a lot of hard work to simply go out and pull a root out of the ground. This is a tuukas. A long time ago they were made from wood and antler but nowadays we have the advantage of steel. This right here I believe comes from farm machinery. The old ladies they used to really watch some of the farm machinery that was out in the fields and when they would see something that would catch their eye often times it was the steel that they would have fashioned into a digging stick because this is very sturdy and it's smaller and it is something that is a little bit easier to use than the wooden ones as I understand it. That is indigenous people taking advantage of technology and this one has a little axe handle top on it.

The motion is along the lines of a lever and you put the tuukas into the ground. You figure the ground is like this, you put the tuukas in at an angle like that and then your root is right about there and then you pop up around it. Then eventually that softens up the soil. Then you reach down in there and you pull the bulb or the root out or whatever it is you are digging for. The important thing to remember is to always cover that back up because that makes it easier for the soil to recover. That is a really important rule. There are rules all around this stuff and you hear some of the old ladies say that you always take the skins that are peeled from your roots back to root digging ground. You put it back to where it was. That is just like the salmon deal that we were talking about yesterday where the salmon asked that they return to the place they were born so they can feed their youth and thus provide a future for their coming generations. It is the same thing with the roots. You don't bring them home, peel them and then just throw the peels in the garbage. You are supposed to take it back out and return it back to its soil."

This is a bit of a newer piece. It has two sides to it because you can see how bright the yarn work is on it. This here is an older style of cornhusk work that doesn't have any yarn in it. These are all dyed cornhusks. The cornhusks, you take the inner portion of the, the inner layers of the husks so you wouldn't rightly use the outside of it, the green areas. You would use the inner three layers because it was softer and it wouldn't be as likely to break when you soaked it. You take those and you hang them out to dry. I remember hanging out cornhusks for some of my older relatives. They would take the cornhusks while it was fresh off the cob and they would tie it into a whole line and then they would hang it in the sunlight. The sunlight would lighten the color and make it brighter and then after that all you had to do was take it down and you would soak it in water. Then you'd tear little strips off from it and you'd use it in weaving. It was always soaked before you wove it into this fashion because it bended easier and it wasn't as likely to break. This is a lot, a lot of work. Here is another example of yarn work. This is similar to the weaving style that you see here, but it's all yarn work. You can see the transition that has occurred between the old style cornhusk that went from, and this is a real nice piece to demonstrate because all of this right here is the old style qému that is twine made from the bark of a plant we use. You can see that in here there is cotton thread that is starting to be used or cotton string and now here it is all cotton. But the other side is all cornhusk. From there we started to use yarn work in conjunction with the cornhusk. Now you can see pieces that are all yarn. This is a real good representation of how are people have changed. I always like the older pieces."

Not only do you have to do the work itself, but you have to prepare the materials for this. It is not something that you can just go to Wal-Mart and buy or go to the shopping center and pick out what you need. You had to prepare all of the string. In order to prepare that string you had to go to the river at a certain time of the year, harvest that plant, make the fiber easily twinable, and then you had to twist up that twine. When you had enough of that then you were able to go on to the next step. That was getting enough of the cornhusk together to make it.

Then if you wanted to put designs in it you had to go to the different plants to get those different colors to make the colors you wanted for your design. Elderberry was one form of dye, wolf moss to get sort of a yellow color. There were things anywhere from berries to bark to the moss that I was referring to, the wolf moss. They always gave a real, real soft color. It is not something real strikingly bright like the yarn we see nowadays. They were softer and more natural.

So the amount of work that goes into something like this (cornhusk work) is enormous compared to something like this (yarn bag). For a piece like this (yarn bag) if you see the inside of this piece you can see it is done with contemporary string and the yarn you can purchase at a craft store. Then the weaving begins. So that is an amazing difference between the amount of work that went into something back then and the amount of work that goes into something now. That is why I always admire the old pieces because I think about the things the people had to go through in order to make them."

This is something that is very important to the identity of our people because it is important for men to help women and it's important for women to help men and their survival. That is why certain things were done by certain people. One of the things that I have noticed is that there are foods that the women take care of and there are foods that the men take care of. Often times the foods that are things like roots and berries, that's things that the women are very good at and taking care of. These are things that go anywhere from capkíicey. This is capkíicey. that my wife has prepared. It is dried. It's dug, boiled, and dried and strung together like this. This is just one of the ways that it is stored. You'll see a difference between the way that it looks. It looks more bulbous than cous. Cous is a bit more irregular while capkíicey tends to be more bulbous in nature. Now cous is taken and it is pounded up into a real fine meal like that or else it is ground often times. What the people will do then is they'll take it and they'll squish it with their hands and they'll make what is called qeqíit. Qeqíit is a real nice treat. Some people call them Indian cookies or treats that people would take while traveling. Sometimes they would mix a little bit of sugar or else maybe some honey in there with it and they would sweeten it up. My mom used to dig a lot of these roots and she would come home and we would grind them up in a hand grinder. Then we would have a large table like this full of ground up cous and we would sit there all day and make qeqíit. Then we would take it out and the children were sitting up on the roof and they would lay a white sheet out on the roof. Then we'd line up all of these things. We'd spread out all of the qeqíit so that it would dry throughout the day. Once it is dried it will keep indefinitely. Things like this because they are so delicious didn't last very long.

The men would take that and put it in the bottom of their quiver or they would tie it onto their hip. The food is really rich. This here is a little bit of salmon that has been prepared in that way. Just this much would sustain a person for a good couple of days because it is so rich and often times it was mixed with different kinds of berries such as elderberry. They would take that and mix it with the different fishes, elk meat, deer meat, mountain sheep meat, moose meat, all the different game animals that our people would harvest from the forest or gather from the forest.
