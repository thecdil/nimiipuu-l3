**No Horns on His Head** (_Tawis sissimnim_, Old worn down horns of a buffalo)

No Horns on His Head came from the Te-sy-yak-pu band. No Horns on His Head was one of the four Nez Perces who traveled to St. Louis in 1831 (?), although there was also two Flatheads who started the journey, they turned back at Council Bluffs. The four that eventually made it to St. Louis were: Speaking Eagle, Kowapoo, No Horns on His Head, and Rabbit Skin Leggings. It is not entirely understood what the intentions of this delegation was, although it has often been highly romanticized by historians and other parties. No Horns on His Head died from an unknown disease shortly after their steamboat "Yellowstone" reached Fort Union in 1832. It was while on the "Yellowstone" when the famous painter George Catlin painted a portrait of No Horn on His Head and his only other surviving companion, Rabbit Skin Leggings.
