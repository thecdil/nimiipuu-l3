My name is Sam Penney. I am the Chairman of the Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee. I would like to welcome you to the Nez Perce web site as part of the Lewis and Clark Rediscovery Project. I encourage you to review this web site prior to coming to visit us in our country. We welcome you with open arms and hope you find the information on this web site useful.

It will give the tribal perspective regarding the coming of Lewis and Clark in 1805, and the much proud heritage we have as the Nez Perce people.

Again I encourage you to visit the web site, come learn about the Nez Perce people and our way of life, and why we are so proud to be called the Nez Perce people. Thank you and enjoy your visit."

nimiipuu-l3-009,Josiah Pinkham interview,2002-03,,"Ethnographer for the Cultural Resource Program, discusses the importance of protecting the material culture for the Nimíipuu. Interviewed by Rodney Frey",https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/L3/Resources/Content/Josiah%20Material%20256.rm,video,"A lot of these things that you see here hold some sort of a symbolism for the Nez Perce that says a little bit of something about who they are. The importance of material culture isn't something that is more important than another thing. But this is how we remember who we are because there are stories about individuals in our past that we think about when we look at these different things. We need to be surrounded by our old things because it is a real threat to our identity if we were to lose these things. From time to time we have lost significant things from our people. Anything from the old eagle feather headdresses that Joseph used to wear to things such as this. Rocks are important because they were used as tools. They were something that we needed in order to process foods in order to survive. That is a real important concept for our people to remember about our identity and the maintenance of that identity, taking care of it, tending to it, making sure that our children are surrounded by the things that express who we are. That shows them how to think about the world, how to survive in the world. I feel that is something that is really important. "
nimiipuu-l3-010,Josiah Pinkham discusses the NAGPRA and ARPA,2002-03,,discusses the NAGPRA (Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act) and ARPA (Archaeological Resource Protection Act Laws associated with protecting the cultural materials of the Nimíipuu. Interviewed by Rodney Frey,https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/L3/Resources/Content/Josiah%20Acts%20256.rm,video,"Another aspect of our protection of our cultural identity tends towards the federal laws that have been implemented in the past to help us protect our identity and to do what is right. There is a NAGPRA law that says that people aren't supposed to be in the possession of human remains and that even goes into those agencies that receive federal funding or are federal agencies. For example, different museums that have Nez Perce things are supposed to notify the Nez Perce tribe so the Nez Perce tribe can evaluate the things that they have and a dialogue can commence from that point to figure out whether or not something should come back to the tribe because a lot of these things are important. They do have sacred significance and they are ceremonial and the Nez Perce tribe would like to decide whether or not something should come back so our children can inherit it and take care of it. Thus, remember who they are and basically be taught who they are.

Along the NAGPRA law lies the ARPA law and that is the Archeological Resource Protection Act, which says that it is illegal for people to take archeological artifacts from federal properties and use them for whatever purposes they would like. That is to protect the archeological resource but also the cultural resource that the Nez Perce see. When something has been lying on the ground for a long time that has archeological significance, but more importantly to the Nez Perce that has cultural significance, that has identity with it. It can be expressed to our children that this is not just a rock. This is a tool that is used in processing food so that you can survive in a distinct way. A way of processing food that is different from the way that Europeans process food or the way that Asian people process food. This is something that expresses who we are in this particular area. So it is really important that people realize there are laws to take care of these kinds of things and make sure that they maintain their proper place in the world. We feel that their proper place tends to be with the people that made them because it restores their cultural context. If anybody wants to learn about the Nez Perce they can come to our country and learn about why we do the things that we do. Why do we put plants on our beadwork? It symbolizes our relationship with plants to help us to survive in the world. So that is something that is really important that we take care of. "

Now we are branching out to other arenas that are just as valid as archaeological protection. When I got hired on I was asked if I could do these type of really strenuous scientific type illustrations of artifacts and cobbles and various other flakes, projectile points. It is very detailed and very specific type of work. It is the kind of work I like to do but to that level it is almost exhausting because it has to be so near perfect in terms of your dimensions and your scale it has to be as much as possible. Through hit and miss I developed several little techniques I used to make that process go a little smoother and to be a little bit more accurate in terms of the scale and whatever I am representing. That is the kind of work I initially got hired on to do. Again, it kind of brings out another area of my type of draftsmanship that I really don't get to showcase. "

nimiipuu-l3-013,Beatrice Miles tells the story of Wetxuuwíis,2001-12,,Aa tribal elder tells the story of Wetxuuwíis. Interviewed by Josiah Pinkham,https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/L3/Resources/Content/Wetxuwiis%20256.rm,video,"Beatrice: That we had Wetxuuwiis, that saved Lewis and Clark.

Josiah: What's the story behind that? How did that come about?

Beatrice: Well, Wetxuuwiis was taken captive as a little girl, from tribe to tribe. And finally, they sold her and she got to New York, into the Great Lakes area. They kept her there and she learned to speak English and she learned to do a lot of things that the Indian woman did, that the White ladies did, showed her how to cook, make things. And she was finally married to a Frenchman and she had a little boy. And one of her friends told her, “you know he is going to take you over on the big waters and it is a great big water and you go over with him.” He was a Frenchman. “You might never return and you might never come back to this country.” And so she escaped. She made a raft and went over one of the lakes and then hitchhiked.

She knew the wolf. The wolf pack went before her and guided her out west, until she got to, before she got to the Flathead country her little son died; he must have been a little boy, maybe 2 or 3 years old. And so she buried him and then went to the Flathead nation. They were kind of close to us. In fact some of our people were part Flathead. But they practiced that, they used to flatten their head. But the Nez Perces never.

And so she finally come home and they were digging, there used to camp where they dug camas and camp around there. When Lewis and Clark came by there were several little boys playing and they saw them coming and they ran back to camp. And Lewis and Clark followed them. And they got to the camp. By that time Wetxuuwiis was pretty old, and she was laying in her bed in a teepee. And then she heard the commotion and she asked what's happening? They said, “Oh, there are some people here. We've never seen people like that before. They have white faces, but there is one black man, maybe he painted his face black.” He was a colored guy, with Lewis and Clark. (York.) She lifted up her teepee and she looked out and said, “soyaapo.” And we figured that word,“soyaapo,” she got back east because we didn't have it. So she must have been that she learned that back east from some other tribe. Then she heard them say, “What shall we do with them, should we kill them?” After she looked outside and saw them she said, “No don't kill them. They're good people. Saved their lives and they'll give you gifts,” she told them. “They're good people.” And they put down their guns or whatever they had. They didn't kill Lewis and Clark because of her. She came back from the Great Lakes and she lived among them. So they spared their lives because of her telling them, “Don't kill them.” And so Lewis and Clark lived. But several of tribes back along the way said, “They should have killed them.” Even some of the Nez Perce said, “they should have killed them.” But she saved their lives. "
nimiipuu-l3-014,Angel Sobotta discusses the importance of Wetxuuwíis for the Nimíipuu,2002-02,,Angel Sobotta discusses the importance of Wetxuuwíis for the Nimíipuu as well as for the soyaapo. Interviewed by Ann McCormack in February 2002,https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/L3/Resources/Content/Angle%20Wetxuwiss%20256.rm,video,"One of the most well known stories in our tribe, and even in our tribe so many people need to learn it, is the Wetxuuwiis story. The Wetxuuwiis story is so vital and instrumental to the Lewis and Clark Corp of Discovery. Without her they may not have been able to continue. She basically saved their lives with what had happened to her and her experience. It is a heroin, a Nez Perce heroin, that came to the rescue of soyaapo, our soyaapo friends Lewis and Clark and the Corp discovery. Because of her experience when she was captured from the enemy tribe she ended up going back east. Further east she ended up being traded to another tribe until finally she ended up in these great waters, the Great Lakes area where she saw the first soyaapo person, the first white people. She, from our tribe, was the first one to see these different type of people and when she was on her journey back she escaped from this enemy tribe and she made it back all the way to her people, the Nimíipuu. She was able to tell them about these new people to come and that they were as many as there were leaves on a tree and that there were just so many and they had all the fine wealth. With her what happened after that, after she was returned, she was stolen or she was lost and she returned. That is what her name Wetxuuwiis means the one that has been captured or the one that has been lost and then they returned. That is where she gets her name.

So when she shared that story over and over again the people were aware of that story and so when they first encountered Lewis and Clark in 1805 they were familiar with the Wetxuuwiis story. They thought these soyaapo people were creatures, people with eyes blue and green and different type of hair. They thought they were creatures. They didn't know if they should kill them or what they should do with them because they were dangerous or they could be something harmful for the tribe. So when she heard of all this talk it was her that said do them no harm these are the people that treated me well after I was stolen. And so they did, the Nez Perce treated them well, treated them friendly, sent them on their journey, kept their horses for year and were good people to them. And we still are. "

In this clip, on knowing of the coming of Lewis and Clark long before their arrival. Interviewed by Josiah Pinkham",https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/L3/Resources/Content/Coming%20256.rm,video,"Josiah: Let's go back to the early 1800's when Lewis and Clark first stumbled out of the mountains, cold and starving. What happened there that people might not witness in the journals? Allen: Well I think there are many things. Everybody assumes or the rendition of present history, in history books, assumed that we didn't know that Lewis and Clark were coming, and they assumed we were just waiting along the trail for civilization to come to us. It wasn't that way. We knew that these people existed; that they were a different kind of people. Some of our people even questioned their humanity; you know, “are they human beings?” When we seen them, we compared them to what was, I guess you would call it a prophesy of the coming of these people. They would come to us and among us, speak a language we never heard before, bring with them good things and bad things. And because they didn't look like us, we questioned, “are they were humans.” And then the discussion went on and on and what we finally decided is that they must have some kind of human attribute because they are similar to us even though they have eyes like fish and they smell. And they do give gifts and they are trying to be friendly Knowing this that they we know these people existed, we knew that on the west coast, we knew that there were certain things that had been brought to us from the west coast that was traded inland to us and also from the east. There were many things traded to us from the eastern tribes. And we traveled extensively. How did we know about all these things prior to Lewis and Clark coming? We must have known those things because we traveled through those areas. We knew where the pipestone quarry was in the Great Lakes area. We knew that to the south it was always hot all year long and also to the north it was always cold. So we knew these things even prior to Lewis and Clark, and we were never given credit for knowing these things. And the way these things show up is in the songs that we sing and also in the prophecies and the predictions and the teachings that are told by our elders. "

Interviewed by Josiah Pinkham",https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/L3/Resources/Content/Allen%20Woman%20256.rm,video,"There are certain assumptions that Lewis and Clark made even before they got here. They had already defined who Indian people were at that time. There is one instance that is in the journals and it is right out here at Potlatch creek. They ugh, were there in this village at Potlatch creek. Then what is says in the journal is that this Nez Perce woman came and started giving away all her possessions, giving everything she owned away to the members of the expedition and then she went into incantations or something and she started to sing and babble along or some other thing. Then she slashed herself and passed out. They assumed she went crazy or the implication is that she went crazy in doing this. Well it is called a certain thing that Indian women did at that time and it is a term called 'isxíipit. And what this is, is that you want to increase your knowledge of something or some people or some person and the way to do that is to confront them and make yourself humble and you it's a sixth, I guess you could call it a sixth sense of trying to increase your knowledge of a particular thing or human being. And this is what she was doing and to see if these people were really the people they really said they were. Are they bringing peace, are they bringing these good things to us and are they going to treat us well. This is the kind of thing that she was trying to find out. This is what's carried on, what used to be called medicine dances, and, and this sort of similar activity. This is mostly restricted to what women did. And so they don't interpret it that way, that she just threw a crazy fit and passed out. But there is a certain, there's a reason why she did that. She wanted to gain knowledge about these strange people and that's the way she was doing it. "

Interviewed by Josiah Pinkham",https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/L3/Resources/Content/Ordway%20256.rm,video,"So now we need to correct all these misinterpretation and misunderstanding. And case in point would be when Ordway came back in 1806. He went back from Kamiah to, up on the prairie and went to look for salmon in the Salomon River. He couldn't find any so he went down to the Snake River, probably through, near Winchester now, and then he went on down to the Snake River, and there he found some salmon, and so he traded and purchased salmon down there. And what occurred the night before he was to come back to Kamiah, bringing salmon with him, he made a note in his journal that the Nez Perce stole salmon from him the night before. So not realizing that there were other things going on in that village where he purchased the salmon, that there is a salmon leader, what we called a “salmon leader” and what the responsibility of the salmon leader was to distribute salmon to all people and to make sure that when they catch the salmon that it is well distributed among all the members of the village people and all the guests. Well I think this is what occurred, that the salmon leader took back some of the salmon that was traded or sold to Ordway, and redistributed to a family or other tribal members that didn't have salmon. But Ordway noted in his journal that fish were stolen; so this is a misunderstanding. And because Ordway and others that were with him couldn't speak Nez Perce and they couldn't convey in sign language what this salmon leader did, it was written in Ordway's journal that the salmon were stolen. But among our people nobody goes without food within the family group or within the village group. So here is this misunderstanding. It is reflected continuously throughout the Lewis and Clark journals and all the other ones that had written journals."

They were signers of the treaty. Everybody was up to Weeppe digging camas. The women were out and the men either were fixing their arrows, bows and arrows or else they were fixing their fishing nets. So they went out on the prairie, kind of going up from where Lawyer camped and going up they saw something coming. They said, “Looks like buffalo,” because they had looked like hair, beards. They thought it was buffalo, “Is that buffalo? No.” So they sneaked along the creek and along the bushes and they saw they were men. Lawyer said we better go back and tell.

They went back to Twisted Hairs camp. He told them that we see some people coming and we don't know who they are but they got long whiskers. Twisted Hair said, “You go this way, you go that way, you go this way and tell the men to come.”

So they all come and they were talking about it. One of them said, “Lets kill them, there is more of us.” North Dakota were about 30 men or less maybe. He said, “We will kill them.” When the women told her about it she send word to Twisted Hair, “Don't kill them. Those kind of people were good to me when I was coming alone. They gave me food to eat and a place to sleep.” She came all alone by herself to Weippe country. So they honored a sick woman, they knew she was going to die and they honored her wish. They didn't kill them. They took them in.

Dad's grandmother told him that Lawyer always said, they were little boys and all the men were in this big two-fire teepee and they crawled under on their bellies. You know how they roll their tents up when it is hot weather and they crawled under the feet of some of those men because you know how you sit cross-legged and they crawled under where their knees are and they looked and were listening to what they were talking about, what they were going to do with these people. They gave them a place to sleep and they had camas. And of course they got fish from the creek and the river. They'd go down to the ""big river"" in Seine (to dip net fish). So they took care of them.

Those men were hungry. You could really get by with one or two camas and that is all you are supposed to eat but those men were hungry. They just filled up with everything, with camas. They all got belly aches. That is when Clark started in on Dr. Rush's pills. You read it in the diary how he give them those pills because they all had the runs. Camas can make you sick if you eat a lot of it. "
nimiipuu-l3-024,Silas Whitman on the impact of the Corps of Discovery on the Nimíipuu,2002-01,,Silas Whitman offers his perspective on the impact of the Corps of Discovery on the Nimíipuu. Interviewed by Josiah Pinkham,https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/L3/Resources/Content/Silas%20256.rm,video,"I tend to agree with people who are of the opinion that we really shouldn't desire not to have been discovered because the noteworthy elements of the tribe are based upon those negative things or connotations to the negatives, which have come because of the discovery. And it would have happened sooner or later based upon prophecies and predictions about what were going to occur, the advent of soyaapo and the advent of society, and different things. We have had a lot of things happen to us that probably were more negative and so irrespective of the things that we are standing for today, for example, the things we have contributed to, it has been to the detriment of our people.

And so I would look at it as a very negative impact on the survival of our people, the lifestyle, and the cultural conditions. We as a society, where we were at that point and time, which was something that we were very much at peace and harmony with the world about us; ecosystems were in place. We were helping to nurture that ecosystem survival the way that we knew how. Then what they call “the Corp of Discovery,” when that came about that drastically altered and changed that environment forever. And so today we have lost a lot of things.

And so I look back at everything that has happened. The advent of society, “civilization,” the advent of the culture and the languages that have overwhelmed our people, Christianity and the churches, all those things that have been tad amount to ethnocide, genocide. All those things have been kind where someone else's destiny has been manifested upon the ills of our people. So I have no other choice but to say that I am one of the leading proponents of the fact that the impacts on the Nez Perce people, the Nimíipuu, put it that way, have been as a result of the support of the Lewis and Clark expedition. We probably would have been better off if we would have eliminated them. Put it that way. "

I've brought my children here (Big Hole Battle Site) for at least the last 10 years and the reason I do that is because I want them to have a strong sense of who they are and have a lot of value about being Nez Perce because a lot of times Indians are portrayed in a very negative light, in a negative way. So by bringing them here they can see that there was a sacrifice made for their life and they do have a responsibility to their friends, to their relatives, and to their family. They are influenced by a lot of things, by T.V., by drugs, by alcohol, by a lot of things that aren't a part of our culture and they need to live in both worlds. Bur they need to be responsible for their decisions and responsible for making good decisions because it reflects on all of us. We give our children Nez Perce names, all my children have their names now so that when they go to the Creator they will recognize them by their Indian name. And it is just a part of learning and growing so that when they have children of their own they can carry that forward. They will have something to teach their children in the next generation. "

It has been a sovereign nation since time immemorial. Before any treaties, before the United States, before Lewis and Clark the Tribe functioned had a government and was a sovereign nation and conducted relations and trades with other sovereign tribes within the area now known as the United States. That is where we start. That sovereignty was recognized by the United States in 1855 when a treaty was entered between this nation and the Nez Perce Tribe. That treaty recognized a territory for the Tribe and it is important to remember that treaty rights aren't something the United State gave to the Tribe. The Nez Perce Tribe in that treaty reserved certain rights to themselves. They reserved the land, they reserved fishing rights, they reserved hunting rights, they reserved rights to gather and graze horses and cattle both within the reservation and outside the reservation. That is where the sovereignty was recognized and since 1855 the Supreme Court and other courts of this nation have recognized treaty rights and the treaty as being the source of sovereignty. That is our legal foundation when we go to any forum that is where we start as far as asserting the sovereignty of the Tribe. "

(Interviewed by Rodney Frey)",https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/L3/Resources/Content/Rick%20Current%20256.rm,video,"The Tribe is involved in a variety of legal cases and other legal initiatives. Probably the biggest group of those cases has to deal with natural resources, specifically salmon because the Tribe since time immemorial depended on salmon for cultural, religious and other purposes. These cases include litigation against the United States Army Corps of Engineers for the operation of the four dams on the lower Snake River. These dams back up water and make the water very hot and actually violate water quality standards in the state of Washington that are part of the Clean Water Act.

So the Tribe filed a lawsuit with some other organizations basically to require the Army Corps to meet these water quality standards, like anyone else would need to. Any other citizen or anyone else operating a dam would also need to meet those water quality standards. That is one case. Another case is called the Snake River Basin Adjudication. That is a water rights case. In that case the Tribe has claimed water rights that are necessary to protect fish. Essentially those treaty rights to fish would be meaningless unless there was water to have fish there. That is another case the tribe is involved.

Other cases the Tribe is involved in there is litigation going on right now over protection of roadless areas in National Forests. Much of the former territory of the Nez Perce Tribe is within National Forests in Idaho, Washington, Oregon, and Montana and those areas much of it is not developed to this day and have no roads and are relatively pristine. This current litigation examines whether or not rules that were promulgated by President Clinton are legal or not. The Tribe has supported those rules. It is important for the Tribe to have that habitat in tact for fish, to protect cultural resources of the Tribe, to protect wildlife and berries and other roots that the Tribe gathers. So the Tribe is involved in that lawsuit.

In addition the Tribe is involved in several other lawsuits against the United States, all related to salmon recovery. The National Marine Fisheries Service who is charge of protecting salmon and steelhead in the Columbia Basin issued a recovery plan, which is called a biological opinion. The Tribe feels that the biological opinion isn't sufficient enough to meet the goals of protecting salmon and steelhead. That it is not going to recover these species to a level that is going to prevent extinction and further that it is not going to recover species in a level that is necessary for the Tribe to exercise its treaty rights. It is important to remember that in order for those treaty rights to be meaningful there needs to be enough fish for the tribe and other people to harvest. So it is more than just preventing extinction, it is making sure that there is a healthy run of fish like there were when Lewis and Clark came. "

Now those are areas that are both within the Reservation, they are within the areas the Tribe had exclusive occupation over before the treaty, as well as areas outside of that. For example, the Tribe's usual and accustomed fishing areas extend all the way to Portland. There are important fisheries there for lamprey eels and other fish; all along the Columbia River, throughout the state of Idaho and even into Montana. As opposed the treaty right to hunt, gather and graze that is described as open and unclaimed lands. Open and unclaimed lands have been interpreted by the court as being lands that are not privately held, forest service lands, BLM lands, lands that are owned by the government, by the federal or state government.

The Nez Perce Tribe's treaty is unique in that at the treaty minutes the chiefs asked, “Could we go to buffalo country and exercise these hunting rights?” Governor Stevens who negotiated the treaty on behalf of the United States said, “Yes, you can go to buffalo country.” Buffalo country was the area around Yellowstone in Montana and Wyoming. So even the hunting rights of the Nez Perce Tribe can extend outside of those areas that the Tribe had exclusive occupation over. But again it would have to be open and unclaimed lands within that are, so federal or state lands within that area. "

If they all started cross breeding and borrowing from each other the next thing you'd know is they would all look like one fish. Well you talk about Pan-Indianism; that's kind of a simple analogy. If you had all of our people of this world start borrowing other people's things and they all start doing the same thing there would be no unique individuals anymore. All the same and that is why I think we should keep our own things and do what we do so we can be recognized for what we do. Everything from the horses to the way we dance, the way we talk, our language, the way we dress, or whatever it is. I think that is important.

They'd all conquer a project together. It wasn't like one person struggling to get it done. A lot of them jumped in and said, “Well, I'll do this.” They kind of did their own little additions to each project, which helped. This we carry on with my sister and my brothers. When they have a project they ask for help and we all jump in to conquer that project. Most of these projects as I've grown up there is not just one person working on them. There is my aunt, me, my mom, and as my sister got older my sister started adding things. Each piece is added even after years have gone by. This is actually taken from an old piece that my grandmother gave me when I was little. I was only like 4 or 5 when I got the leggings and the moccasins and hair ties. That was probably my first pieces. I've got the leggings in here but I had to redo them because through the years they have gotten really worn. But these are really old; they are probably older than I am. This design has come from my grandmother, one of her designs she did. What I did was remounted it, put it on new buckskin and then added more edging. This is some of my work up here. I kind of refurbished an old piece and make it usable again and then keep my grandmother's work going. This is how it goes. Our ladies would wear the ties on the side. A lot of these women nowadays they wear the ties on the inside but our women didn't wear them like that. There are a lot of reasons to that. Number one our women were horse riders and if you wear your legging on this way you'll get hung up on something for sure and probably drug. That is why they are worn this way. They are usually tied but with today's new inventions and what not you got the Velcro. I added that, that is not an old idea. It is pretty new stuff but I always put the ties on it just in case because as you dance it may come undone. You can't always rely on soyaapo. You always have to go back to your old buckskin."

This is cornhusk and when I started getting back into cornhusk this is what my mother kept wanting me to do because she figured I'd be the only one to do it. My sisters don't get involved with this stuff. She took me to visit with Katherine Ramsey and Katherine was filling me in. She brought out all her bags, she showed me and I was just astound at how much work she had done. She was telling me how the cornhusk was done. When you take the cornhusk you take the inner husk from the corn. You don't use the outside because it is too rough and too thick. But the inner cornhusk is what you take and you can put a string through it and tie it up to bleach it during the summertime. When you do a weaving you'll slice just a small, small piece like that and then it will naturally be wet. It'll be wet and then you'll just wrap it around your string here, your twine. It'll be just a twist around, then you just twist it and twine it in there. This is a big project; it is going to take a long time.

Now this one it just sort of came together. I started with just a plain color and then I used a corrugated, which gives a natural design as you are weaving it up. Then I got up here and just started adding my cornhusk to it. Then I added the cedar; this is died yellow cedar and red cedar. I put that in there. Most of my work I have more or less tried, since I started with cedar, I tried to put cedar into my bags, whether it is cornhusk. So I have used yellow cedar in these and also the regular yarn but I always try to keep some parts Nez Perce. "

I knew that back at home we have several talented people that could do all kinds of different things that I wanted to help expose.

The Nez Perce didn't make trade cloth but they traded for it and it was traded into our people. They always liked this little white border that was on it. The way that it is prepared is that you put a piece of canvas over this and you sew it so that it makes a sturdy edge or there were a few different reasons why they did this. That is why it is purple on the bottom side right here, because it was curled under like that and then sewed and then it is dipped into dye.

Once that hair starts to fall off and it's in the water long enough you can take your hand and take that hair off. It'll come right off real good. I usually try to wait until the hair will come off like that before you monkey with it because you can take the hair off of a hide in about 15-20 minutes, if you go like a bat out of hell. If you just take your time about it maybe it would take you a half an hour or so to take the hair off. Then get a couple of you to stretch it out and nail it down to dry.

There would be earth oakers and then they would cover it with another layer of, like hide glue, to protect that surface. Then it was turned over and the hair was pounded off from it and it would make this rawhide area around here a little bit white. This one here isn't pounded so you can see through it a little bit.

I used the real modern cuts of beads, the trycuts. Unfortunately a lot of the early colors that were used by our people, the old Italian beads that were used and they were so, the depth of the beads were so great because of the natural pigments that they used in producing the beads that are unfortunately no longer. I had to substitute for modern colors and what not. That is where you get a lot and plus the sparkle it is kind of, when you are dancing in contest type of dancing it really makes you stand out.

I was also told by some of my people who I rely upon for advice and knowledge that sparkly things are always favored by Plateau people.

Again that goes back to the dance and the strength that you have to have and that you have to exhibit when you dance because a lot of people are watching you and not all of them are thinking positive thoughts towards you for whatever reason. So it is important to have these things made in a certain way. This is done in, you can tell, geometric work. It is reminiscent of Nez Perce geometric designs. Often times it closely resembles the work that is done out in the Plains by the Crows. It often is confused but there are some subtle differences that our work has that theirs doesn't, as well theirs does that ours doesn't have. "
