## Traditional Use and Influence Map 

Illustrating the extent of aboriginal use and influence (from Celilo Falls to Kettle Falls on the Columbia River, from the Yellowstone region to the Lower Snake River area), and the successive reservation boundaries established by the Treaties of 1855 and 1863, as well as the Indian Claims Commission (ICC) boundary. Note the reference to the Bear Paw and Big Hole Battle sites, part of the Conflict of 1877.

## Tribal and Allotment Lands

c. 2000, of some 185,000 acres. Tribal fee and trust lands are noted in green, while individual Nez Perce-owned allotments are noted in pink. The allotment process resulted in a land-base in which the tribe and its members only owned approximately 80,000 acres within the reservation boundaries of some 750,000 acres in 1975. A tribal land acquisition program has increased Nez Perce ownership to some 185,000 acres today. Of the 13 million acres once controlled by the Nimíipuu, less than 1.4% of that aboriginal territory is actually owned by the tribe and its members today.
