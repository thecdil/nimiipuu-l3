# Yvonne LeCornn reads one of her poems, "Native American Goddess and Alaskan Native Queen." (Interviewed by Ann McCormack, March 2002)

Being native not by choice

But being proud is in my voice

When someone asks what ethnic am I

I smile and I proudly reply,

“I am Nez Perce and Haida or Haida and Nez Perce

In this case it doesn’t matter which one I say first

I don’t say that I am one or the other

Because to me both sides are in this together

I am a common nation two of the same

I have some white that I do not claim

But I am not here to say which race is wrong or right

I am here to say who I am tonight

I am a Native American Goddess and an Alaskan Native Queen

To me I am the most beautiful seen

I have long brown hair and big brown eyes

I ain’t skinny and that is no surprise

But body and looks only last awhile

It’s your mind, body and soul that will take you the extra mile

We need to stop the fighting and that is for sure

Otherwise it will affect our children’s future

Because in reality we are sisters and brothers

We need to raise our kids to respect each other

I will not let my daughter fight name to name

She will be raised that we are all the same.

We need to stand together and stop the battle within

If we do not do this our children won’t win

So lets stop the fight and start to unite

And that is why I am here to say who I am tonight

I am a Native American Goddess and an Alaskan Native Queen

We are all intelligent you know what I mean

I don’t mean to stand here and begin to preach

But someone must begin to teach

It may not be me but one of you

I am just here to share my clue

So listen close to what I am about to say

If you believe in this then you should pray

We need to stand together side by side

Unite all Indians far and wide

Spreading our native pride

Effecting the country nationwide

I know that you believe what I say is real

Because this is honestly and truly how I feel

I will stand with my natives and always fight

And that is why I am here to say who you I am tonight

I am a Native American Goddess and an Alaskan Native Queen

We are the most beautiful seen.
