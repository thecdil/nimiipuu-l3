**Rabbit Skin Leggings** (_Heeyuxc tohon_)

Rabbit Skin Leggings was from Lumtamapu, although his mother was a Palouse. He was the nephew of Speaking Eagle, who was the eldest and leader of the delegation. Rabbit Skin Leggings was the sole survivor of the trip to St. Louis, while on his way home he met a group of Nez Perces in "Buffalo Country" and stayed with them. It was later told that he was unwilling to return to his own people and chose to live among white trappers. He also cropped his hair and wore non-native apparel. He was later killed by the Blackfeet in a battle at the headwaters of the Salmon River, one year after returning from St. Louis.
